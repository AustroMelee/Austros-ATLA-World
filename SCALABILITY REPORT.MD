Overall Preparedness Score: 40%
The system has a strong foundation in some areas, particularly in its generic UI components and the data-driven approach for defining top-level characters and locations. However, it is significantly held back by hard-coded logic for core entities like moves, AI behaviors, and narrative pools, which prevents a "plug-and-play" architecture. Adding a new character would require modifying several core system files, not just adding new data and assets.
Below is a detailed breakdown of what needs to occur to achieve 100% preparedness.
Checklist Analysis & Path to 100%
Here is a point-by-point breakdown of what needs to be implemented or refactored to meet the checklist requirements.
1. No Hard-Coding of Core Entities (Status: 20% - FAILED)
Current State: There are numerous direct, hard-coded references to specific characters (Aang, Azula) within core logic files.
features/battle-simulation/types/move.types.ts: Directly exports AANG_MOVES and AZULA_MOVES. This is the most critical issue. Moves should not be defined in a types file and should not be character-specific exports.
features/battle-simulation/services/ai/behaviorTreeEngine.ts: Uses a switch statement on character.name to directly import and use aangAIRules and azulaAIRules. This is a hard-coded dependency.
features/battle-simulation/services/narrative/pools/narrative.pools.ts: Acts as a manual registry that directly imports character-specific narrative files (aang.narrative.ts, azula.narrative.ts).
To Achieve 100%:
Refactor Moves: Create a single, unified moves.ts or moves.json file that defines all moves in the game, each with a unique ID. Moves should be generic (e.g., "Fireball", "Air Shield") and not tied to a character in their definition.
Decouple AI Logic: The behaviorTreeEngine.ts (or any AI controller) must not know about specific characters. Instead, the Character data object should contain a property like aiProfile: 'aang_rules' or aiRulesetId: 'aggressive_airbender'. The engine would then use this ID to look up the correct rule set from an AIRulesRegistry.
Abstract Narrative Pools: Narrative pools should be loaded into a NarrativeRegistry keyed by character ID. The narrative service should query this registry, not import files directly.
2. Explicit Registries & Factories (Status: 40% - PARTIAL)
Current State: The system uses data files like characterData.ts and locationData.ts which function as implicit registries. This is a good start. However, there are no formal registries for moves, AI rules, or narrative pools.
To Achieve 100%:
Create a MoveRegistry: This service or object would load all moves from the new unified moves.ts file and provide a function like MoveRegistry.getById('fireball'). No service should ever import a move directly.
Create an AIRuleRegistry: Similar to the move registry, this would hold all possible AI rule sets, referenced by an ID.
Formalize Character/Location Registries: Instead of just exporting an array, create a CharacterRegistry service with methods like getCharacter(id) and getAllCharacters(). This makes the dependency explicit.
Enforce Factory Pattern: Ensure that createInitialBattleState is the only way a battle-ready character object is created. The UI should pass a character ID or data object to the battle controller, which then uses the factory to instantiate the live BattleCharacter.
3. Data-Driven, Not File-Driven (Status: 60% - PARTIAL)
Current State: This is a mix. Character and Location definitions in characterData.ts and locationData.ts are excellent examples of being data-driven. However, Moves, AI Rules, and Narrative Lines are defined in TypeScript (.ts) files, mixing data with code.
To Achieve 100%:
Migrate Moves to Data: Move all definitions from move.types.ts (like AANG_MOVES) into a data/moves.json or data/moves.ts that exports a pure data array/object.
Migrate Narrative to Data: While the narrative.pools.ts system is well-structured, the lines themselves are in .ts files. For true data-driven design, these should be in JSON or YAML files, allowing writers who are not developers to contribute without touching code. The engine would then load these data files at runtime or build time.
Make AI Data-Driven: AI rules in rules/aangRules.ts are defined as code. A more scalable approach would be to define AI behavior in a data format (e.g., a JSON defining priorities, conditions, and actions) that a generic AI engine can interpret.
4. Pluggable Narrative & Mechanics (Status: 25% - FAILED)
Current State: The system is not fully pluggable. As noted, the AI engine uses a switch statement on character names, and the narrative system relies on a manual import registry. This is the opposite of a pluggable architecture.
To Achieve 100%:
Eliminate Switch Statements: Refactor behaviorTreeEngine.ts and any similar logic. The character's data object should specify its aiRulesetId. The engine uses this ID to fetch the rules from the AIRuleRegistry.
Use an Event System or Hooks: For mechanics, instead of if (character.name === 'Aang'), the system should use an event bus or hooks. For example, when a "parry" event occurs, the engine checks if the character has a registered onParry handler defined in its data, rather than hard-coding the logic.
8. Test/Validate New Entity Flow (Status: 20% - FAILED)
Current State: The current process for adding a new character would be invasive. To add a character "Zuko", a developer would have to:
Add Zuko's data to characterData.ts. (Good)
Add Zuko's moves to move.types.ts as a new ZUKO_MOVES export. (Bad)
Create src/features/battle-simulation/services/ai/rules/zukoRules.ts. (Bad)
Edit behaviorTreeEngine.ts to add a case 'zuko': to the switch statement. (Very Bad - modifying core logic)
Create src/features/battle-simulation/services/narrative/pools/zuko.narrative.ts. (Bad)
Edit narrative.pools.ts to import and add zukoNarrativePool. (Bad - modifying a registry file)
To Achieve 100%:
Adding a new character ("Zuko") should only require these steps:
Add a zuko.json file to a /data/characters/ directory. This file would contain all stats, asset paths, and IDs for their moves, AI ruleset, and narrative pool.
(Optional) Add a zuko_narrative.json to /data/narratives/.
(Optional) Add a zuko_ai.json to /data/ai_rules/.
Add art assets to the assets folder.
The registries should auto-discover these files and load them. The character should immediately appear in the UI and be fully functional in battle with zero changes to any existing engine or service code.
10. CI/Test Coverage for Plug-and-Play (Status: 0% - FAILED)
Current State: There are no test files in the provided codebase. There is no automated process to validate that adding a new character or location works as expected.
To Achieve 100%:
Create a "Drop-in Test": Implement an automated test (e.g., using Vitest or Jest) that programmatically creates a new character data object, registers it, and runs a mock battle simulation.
CI Integration: Add this test to the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions). The build should fail if a developer's changes break the "new entity" flow.
11. DevDocs: "How to Add X" (Status: 50% - PARTIAL)
Current State: The SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.MD document is excellent and very detailed. However, it describes how the system works now, not how to extend it. It is missing the explicit "How to Add a New Character" and "How to Add a New Location" cookbook sections.
To Achieve 100%:
Add Cookbook Sections: Once the architecture is refactored to be truly plug-and-play, create step-by-step guides in SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.MD detailing the process. For example:
How to Add a New Character
Create a new file: /data/characters/zuko.json.
Fill out the character data following the Character schema.
Add move IDs to the movePool array. Ensure these moves exist in data/moves.json.
Add icon and image assets to /public/assets/characters/.
Commit your changes. The character will be auto-discovered.
Summary of Other Checklist Items
#5 Swappable Assets & Icons: (100% - PASSED) This is implemented very well.
#9 UI is Fully Generic: (100% - PASSED) The UI is well-decoupled and consumes data via props.
#6 Dynamic Import/Lazy Loading: (0% - FAILED) Not implemented, but not critical at the current scale.
#7 No Import Loops or Cross-Talk: (20% - FAILED) The codebase has significant cross-talk, with core services directly importing character-specific logic.
