The Southern Water Tribe consists of scattered small villages across an island at the South Pole. Devastated by a century of Fire Nation raids during the Hundred Year War, the tribe was on the brink of extinction by the war's end. However, after the war, volunteers from the Northern Water Tribe helped rebuild it, leading to a major expansion. By 171 AG, it had developed into a large harbor city as its capital.
