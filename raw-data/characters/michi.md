### üìñ Overview

Michi was a Fire Nation noblewoman, the wife of Ukano (former governor of New Ozai), and mother to Mai and Tom-Tom. Proud of her social standing, she supported her husband's career but ultimately prioritized her family's safety and well-being. After the Hundred Year War, she became skeptical of Ukano's opposition to Fire Lord Zuko and separated from him when he tried to indoctrinate their children against the new government. Michi later helped her sister Mura run a flower shop and encouraged her children to seek new opportunities, supporting them through difficult times.
