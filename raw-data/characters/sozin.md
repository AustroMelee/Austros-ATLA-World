- Name: Sozin
- Nation: Fire Nation
- Age: 102 (at time of death)
- Overview: Once the best friend of Avatar Roku, Prince Sozin's ascension to Fire Lord ignited his ambition to expand his nation's influence across the globe. Believing he was sharing the Fire Nation's greatness, his vision was rejected by Roku.
