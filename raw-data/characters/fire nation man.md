## UI - EXPANDED VIEW

Fire Nation Man was an earthbender who fought in the Earth Rumble tournaments in Gaoling. His stage name and persona were designed to generate audience enthusiasm by playing the villain, but he was not actually a Fire Nation citizen. An immigrant from the Si Wong Desert, he specialized in dirt-based attacks and showmanship. He was quickly defeated by The Boulder and later by Toph Beifong. His persona included a Fire Nation flag, red cloak, and a stereotypical Fire Nation hairstyle, and he would sing the Fire Nation anthem before matches.
