### üìñ Overview

Hide is a student at a Fire Nation school, recognized for his muscular build, aggressive attitude, and possessive behavior toward On Ji.

Hide‚Äôs confrontations with Aang (posing as Kuzon) highlight his quick temper and lack of self-awareness. He is a star pupil in the Fire Nation system, destined for a strict military future, but is ultimately portrayed as a comic antagonist.
