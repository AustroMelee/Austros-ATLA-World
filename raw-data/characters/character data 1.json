Minor characters like unnamed villagers or one-off antagonists often have minimal narrative impact, so this list prioritizes those with memorable roles. For a complete list, including all minor characters, refer to the Avatar Wiki categories for ATLA characters (249 characters) and LOK characters (181 characters).\r\nSources 📚\r\n\r\nList of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters - Wikipedia\r\nAvatar Wiki\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive overview ensures that key characters from ATLA, LOK, and the comics are represented, providing a clear and organized reference for fans of the Avatar universe."
