## UI - EXPANDED VIEW

Hahn was a slick, career-minded soldier who resided in the Northern Water Tribe and was focused solely on the Hundred Year War. Due to Hahn's high ranking, Chief Arnook arranged a marriage between him and Princess Yue. However, this marriage never took place due to Yue's death. Often considered by women as the most handsome warrior in the Northern Tribe, Hahn preoccupied himself with making a good impression on his superiors.

Although he was not a waterbender, he showed skill in handling a variety of weapons and was a respected warrior, having been chosen to lead a secret attack on the Fire Navy's commanding officer during the Siege of the North. These skills, however, were not as impressive as he thought them to be, as during the mission, Hahn was unable to effectively attack the fleet's commanding officer, Admiral Zhao.
