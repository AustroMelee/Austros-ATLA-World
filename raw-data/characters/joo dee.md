### üìñ Overview

Joo Dee is the ever-smiling, brainwashed tour guide and bureaucrat of Ba Sing Se. She was programmed by the Dai Li to keep visitors compliant and neutralize outside influences, serving as both a guide and later as Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator.

### üß© Role in the Story

Joo Dee was one of a number of public servants in Ba Sing Se using the same name who had been brainwashed by the Dai Li to be a guide for important visitors to the city. Her robotic, cheery demeanor, mechanical mannerisms, and tendency to hold the party line were all the result of brainwashing. Joo Dee once served as a caretaker and tour guide for Team Avatar after their arrival in the city, and later as Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator under Azula. Her primary purpose was to neutralize unwanted outside influences and maintain the city's official narrative.
