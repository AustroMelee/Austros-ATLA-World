Ensuring Completeness ✅
This list covers major, supporting, and notable minor characters from ATLA, LOK, and the comics, as requested. Due to the extensive number of characters (over 400 across both series and comics, per Avatar Wiki), including every minor character is impractical here. Minor characters like unnamed villagers or one-off antagonists often have minimal narrative impact, so this list prioritizes those with memorable roles. For a complete list, including all minor characters, refer to the Avatar Wiki categories for ATLA characters (249 characters) and LOK characters (181 characters).
