### 📖 Overview

Combustion Man, also known as "Sparky Sparky Boom Man," was a fearsome firebending assassin infamous for his unique combustionbending technique. Towering at over seven feet tall, with a third-eye tattoo and metal prosthetic limbs, he was hired by Prince Zuko to hunt down and kill Avatar Aang. His silent demeanor, relentless pursuit, and overwhelming power made him one of the most dangerous adversaries Team Avatar ever faced.
