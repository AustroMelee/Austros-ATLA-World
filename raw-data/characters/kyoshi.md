### üìñ Overview

Kyoshi was the physically imposing and long-lived Earth Kingdom Avatar who believed that only true, uncompromising justice could bring peace, a philosophy that shaped the world for centuries. Abandoned as a child and not discovered as the Avatar until her teens, Kyoshi's early life was defined by hardship and survival. This forged her into a pragmatic and ruthlessly effective Avatar who valued justice above all else. During her 230-year lifespan, she ended the tyrannical conquest of Chin the Conqueror, founded both the elite Kyoshi Warriors and the Dai Li, and brought about an unprecedented era of peace, leaving a complex and enduring legacy.
