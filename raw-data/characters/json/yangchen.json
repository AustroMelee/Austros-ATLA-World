Unlike many Air Nomads, she was not a strict pacifist and understood that maintaining peace sometimes required manipulation, espionage, and force. Her tireless efforts and difficult compromises secured an entire generation of peace after her death, though her focus on humanity's problems inadvertently led to a rise in dark spirits for her successor, Kuruk.",
