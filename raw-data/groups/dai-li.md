### üìñ Overview

The Dai Li is the elite secret police force of Ba Sing Se, originally founded by Avatar Kyoshi to protect the city's cultural heritage. Over time, the organization became corrupt and ruthless. During the Hundred Year War, they fell under the control of Grand Secretariat Long Feng, enforcing a police state within the capital and suppressing all mention of the war. Their loyalty was so detached from the Earth Kingdom that they eventually sided with Princess Azula, aiding the Fire Nation in the successful Coup of Ba Sing Se.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Founding:** Created by Avatar Kyoshi between 270 and 82 BG to preserve Ba Sing Se's culture after a peasant uprising.
- **Corruption:** Exploited by Long Feng to take control of Ba Sing Se, reducing the Earth King to a figurehead.
- **Conspiracy of Ba Sing Se:** Actively suppressed any mention of the Hundred Year War within the city walls and brainwashed dissidents under Lake Laogai.
- **Coup of Ba Sing Se:** Betrayed Long Feng to ally with Princess Azula, assisting the Fire Nation in conquering the city.
- **Allegiance to Azula:** Served as Princess Azula's personal bodyguards in the Fire Nation until being banished by her during a paranoid breakdown.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Dai Li serve as primary antagonists during the Ba Sing Se arc. They are the physical embodiment of the city's corruption, hindering Team Avatar's attempts to see the Earth King and enforcing Long Feng's conspiracy of silence about the war. Their formidable earthbending skills and ruthless tactics make them a significant threat, culminating in their critical role in Azula's defeat of Aang in the Crystal Catacombs.
