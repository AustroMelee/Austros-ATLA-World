### üìñ Overview

The military of the Earth Kingdom is the vast armed forces responsible for defending the continent. Commanded by the Council of Five in Ba Sing Se, it is the largest army in the world by sheer numbers. It consists of earthbenders, non-bending foot soldiers, and specialized cavalry. Though technologically inferior to the Fire Nation, the Earth Kingdom military was able to hold out for a century through stalwart defense, guerrilla tactics, and the sheer determination of its soldiers. The military includes several specialized divisions, such as the Kyoshi Warriors and the Royal Earthbender Guards.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Hundred Year War:** Fought a century-long defensive war against the Fire Nation, suffering many defeats but preventing a total collapse for 100 years.
- **Siege of Ba Sing Se (95 AG):** Successfully repelled General Iroh's legendary siege of the capital city.
- **Battle of the Drill:** With help from Team Avatar, successfully defended Ba Sing Se's Outer Wall from a massive Fire Nation drill.
- **Coup of Ba Sing Se (100 AG):** The military's high command, the Council of Five, was neutralized by the Dai Li, leading to the city's fall and the army's fragmentation.
- **Day of Black Sun:** Remnant forces joined the invasion of the Fire Nation, but were captured after its failure.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Earth Kingdom military represents the primary force of resistance against the Fire Nation. Its soldiers and generals are frequent allies to Team Avatar, though some, like General Fong, prove to be misguided. The military's struggle highlights the immense scale of the war and the resilience of the Earth Kingdom people. Specialized groups within the military, like the Kyoshi Warriors, serve as important recurring allies.
