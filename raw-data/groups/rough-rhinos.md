### üìñ Overview

The Rough Rhinos were an elite cavalry unit within the Fire Nation military, founded and led by Colonel Mongke. The group consisted of five members, each a specialist with a unique weapon, including an archer, a rock-flail wielder, and a explosives expert. They were renowned for their skill and their ability to ride their komodo rhino mounts silently through the brush, making them an effective raiding and intimidation force.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Terrorizing Earth Kingdom Villages:** Under Colonel Mongke, they were tasked with intimidating Earth Kingdom villages and suppressing resistance.
- **Confrontation with Iroh:** The unit was famously defeated by General Iroh, who was defending a village.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Rough Rhinos are introduced as a veteran, intimidating force representing the Fire Nation's control over conquered Earth Kingdom territory. Their defeat at the hands of Iroh serves to establish his immense power, wisdom, and compassionate nature, as he chooses to defend the innocent rather than continue his siege of Ba Sing Se. They act as a benchmark for what a truly powerful master can accomplish.
