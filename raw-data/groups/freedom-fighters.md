### üìñ Overview

The Freedom Fighters were a small, independent group of teenage rebels who fought against the Fire Nation in the forests of the Earth Kingdom. Led by the charismatic but vengeful Jet, they used guerrilla tactics to sabotage Fire Nation operations. Their methods were often extreme, culminating in a plan to flood a Fire Nation-occupied village, which would have killed innocent civilians. After Jet's death, the remaining members joined the larger resistance movement.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Formation:** Formed by Jet and other orphans of the war to fight the Fire Nation.
- **Encounter with Team Avatar:** Befriended Team Avatar but were abandoned after their plan to destroy a dam was revealed.
- **Relocation to Ba Sing Se:** Traveled to the capital city, where Jet was captured, brainwashed, and ultimately killed by the Dai Li.
- **Day of Black Sun:** The remaining members joined the invasion force against the Fire Nation.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Freedom Fighters serve as a cautionary tale about the cost of war and how a desire for justice can curdle into extremism. They present Team Avatar with a moral dilemma, forcing them to confront the idea that not all who fight the Fire Nation are necessarily noble. Jet's tragic arc, from rebel leader to brainwashed pawn, highlights the insidious nature of the Ba Sing Se conspiracy.
