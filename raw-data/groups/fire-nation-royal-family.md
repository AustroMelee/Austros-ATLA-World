### üìñ Overview

The Fire Nation Royal Family is the ruling family of the Fire Nation. Although it has dominated the country for centuries, the family has known great strife during its history, and was marked by brutal feuds and the struggle for absolute power. As a result of marriages and affairs, the Fire Nation Royal Family is related to several other Fire Nation noble families such as the Saowon and Keohso clans.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Unification Era**: Originally ruled by Fire Sages with Fire Lord at their head
- **Power Shift**: Fire Lord gained more power and split from Fire Sages
- **Pho Zel Dynasty**: One of many dynasties in the family's long history
- **Hundred Year War**: Sozin instigated the conflict and began tradition of favoritism
- **Modern Era**: Zuko ended the war and stopped the favoritism that plagued the family

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The royal family serves as the primary antagonist force throughout much of the Avatar series, with their quest for power and domination driving the Hundred Year War. Their internal conflicts and power struggles create complex character dynamics, particularly between siblings like Zuko and Azula. The family's transformation under Zuko's leadership represents the possibility of redemption and change.
