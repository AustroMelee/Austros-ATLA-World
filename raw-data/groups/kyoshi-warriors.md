### üìñ Overview

The Kyoshi Warriors are an order of elite female fighters dedicated to protecting their home, Kyoshi Island. Founded by Avatar Kyoshi herself, they honor her legacy by wearing her iconic kabuki-style makeup and green armor. Despite being non-benders, they are formidable combatants, utilizing metal fans and a unique fighting style that turns an opponent's strength against them. Led by Suki, they are initially isolationist but later join the war effort, becoming valuable allies to Team Avatar.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Founding:** Established by Avatar Kyoshi to protect her home island.
- **Encounter with Team Avatar:** Initially capture the team but later befriend them, with Suki training Sokka.
- **Joining the War:** Left Kyoshi Island to help fight the Fire Nation, aiding refugees across the Serpent's Pass.
- **Capture and Imprisonment:** Suki and the other warriors were captured by Azula's forces and imprisoned at the Boiling Rock.
- **Liberation and Final Battle:** Suki was rescued from the Boiling Rock by Sokka and Zuko, and she and the other warriors later assisted in disabling the Fire Nation airship fleet during the finale.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Kyoshi Warriors serve as important recurring allies to Team Avatar. They represent the strength and capability of non-benders in a world dominated by bending. Their leader, Suki, becomes a key member of the group and Sokka's love interest. Their journey from isolationist protectors to active participants in the war demonstrates the conflict's global reach and the need for everyone to contribute to the fight for balance.
