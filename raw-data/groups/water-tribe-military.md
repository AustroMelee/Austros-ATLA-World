### üìñ Overview

The military of the Water Tribe comprises the distinct forces of the Northern Water Tribe and the Southern Water Tribe. The North maintained a large, organized standing army and navy protected within the walls of Agna Qel'a. The South, devastated by Fire Nation raids, relied on a smaller, mobile militia of warriors who left home to fight. Though their equipment was less advanced than the Fire Nation's, their warriors were courageous, and their waterbenders used the polar environment to their advantage, making them formidable defenders of their homelands.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Early Hundred Year War:** The combined Water Tribe fleets were defeated by the Fire Nation Navy, isolating the tribes.
- **Southern Water Tribe Raids:** The Southern military was decimated and its benders captured, leading to a force of nonbending warriors.
- **Siege of the North:** The Northern Tribe's military, with the help of Team Avatar, successfully repelled a massive invasion led by Admiral Zhao.
- **Invasion of the Fire Nation:** Southern warriors, led by Hakoda, joined the coalition force for the failed invasion on the Day of Black Sun.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Water Tribe military represents the resilience and defiance of a people under siege. The Southern warriors, particularly Hakoda and Sokka's storyline, embody the sacrifice required to fight a global war. The Northern military's stand during the Siege of the North is a pivotal moment in the series, showcasing the power of waterbending on a massive scale and resulting in the spiritual transformation of Princess Yue.
