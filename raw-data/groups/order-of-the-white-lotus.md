### üìñ Overview

The Order of the White Lotus is an ancient and formerly secret society that transcends the boundaries of the four nations. Formed by scholars and masters from around the world, the group is dedicated to the pursuit of philosophy, beauty, and truth. Members communicate their affiliation through the strategic placement of tiles in the game of Pai Sho. While historically operating from the shadows to guide and protect the Avatar, the Order revealed itself publicly at the end of the Hundred Year War to liberate Ba Sing Se from Fire Nation control.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Ancient Origins:** Formed as a club for ancient masters to challenge one another at Pai Sho.
- **Hundred Year War:** Maintained a low profile, with key members like Iroh joining its ranks.
- **Liberation of Ba Sing Se:** Under the leadership of Grand Lotus Iroh, the Order's masters united and retook the Earth Kingdom capital from the Fire Nation during Sozin's Comet.
- **Public Debut:** After the war, the society stopped concealing itself and began to serve the world and the Avatar more openly.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Order of the White Lotus serves as a powerful, benevolent force that reveals itself in the final act of the Hundred Year War. They represent a level of wisdom and cooperation that transcends national conflict. Their intervention is crucial, as they single-handedly liberate Ba Sing Se, demonstrating the combined strength of the world's greatest masters and providing critical support to Team Avatar's final mission.
