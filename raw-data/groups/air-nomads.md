### üìñ Overview

The Air Nomads is the collective term for the monastic order of men and women who practice the discipline of airbending and the pacifistic ethics of their theocratic society. One of the four nations, the Air Nomads were wanderers by definition, but had four air temples, one located at each corner of the globe, found atop mountain ranges and under cliffs, in the northern Earth Kingdom and on three remote islands, all of which were hard for outsiders to reach.

The Air Nomads were a peaceful race who lived in large temples and travelled the world on flying bison. They were the most spiritual of all the cultures and lived in harmony with nature. Their culture valued both altruism and detachment from wealth and worldly affairs, and their relationship with the other nations varied between different eras.

Unlike the other nations, those born to the Air Nomads were, without any seen exception, all benders due to the high level of spirituality of their people. They had the smallest population of the four nations and a small economy based entirely on limited agriculture.
