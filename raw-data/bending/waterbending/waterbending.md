Healing[4]
Waterbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the hydrokinetic ability to control water in all of its various forms. This type of bending is used by the people of the Water Tribe, who are divided into the Southern, Northern, and lesser-known Foggy Swamp tribes, as well as those of the United Republic, each with their own unique bending style.
Water is the element of change.[1] The moon is the source of power in waterbending, and the original waterbenders learned to bend by observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides.[2] The Water Tribes are the only people who did not learn to bend from an animal, though the Moon and Ocean Spirits took the form of koi fish in the mortal world near the beginning of the Avatar world.

The fighting style of waterbending is mostly fluid and graceful, acting in concert with the environment. Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy; they let their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' own forces against them. Even when waterbenders do take an attack stance, their moves always appear to flow from one to the other, mimicking the flow of the water they bend. Foggy Swamp style waterbending, however, is more rigid and straight, allowing for more direct bursts instead of long flowing streams of water.[5]

Origin
Water lion turtle
A water lion turtle bestowed the power of water to those who lived atop its shell.

During the era of Raava, the power of water was first granted by the water lion turtle, who would temporarily provide it as protection to those venturing into the Spirit Wilds. However, after the lion turtles renounced their roles as protectors of mankind during the era of the Avatar, the turtles refused to give people the power anymore. The descendants of the people living atop the water lion turtle eventually learned to waterbend by observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides of the ocean; they learned how to simulate the effect themselves.[2] As such, they have a strong spiritual connection to the Moon and its counterpart, the Ocean. In fact, waterbending is the only bending art to originate from spirits instead of animals, and additionally, any adverse effect on these spirits detrimentally affects waterbenders.

Fighting style
Waterbending scroll
The waterbending scroll contains illustrations of various techniques.

Waterbending's strength is its great versatility. Rather than supporting a separate set of offensive methods, waterbending employs defensive techniques that can be transformed into attacks and counters, defense into offense. Instead of simply deflecting an attack, waterbending's defensive maneuvers focus on control, achieved through turning an opponent's own strength against them, rather than directly harming the opponent.

Waterbending abilities and techniques
Breath of ice: A waterbender can use the water vapor in their breath to rapidly freeze objects or opponents. For a more advanced version of the technique, the user takes a deep breath and exhales the air as a cloud of freezing mist. Katara used this technique to freeze Jet to a tree,[6] to save Sokka from Huu,[5] and to stop a warship from sinking by temporarily freezing a hole in the ship's hull. Avatar Aang also used this ability to break the chain when Bumi was being lifted by a crane.[7]

Creeping ice[8]: A waterbender can send a ray of ice on the ground, speeding at an opponent to freeze them. This technique freezes a trail of water beginning with the waterbender performing the move and ending with their targets freezing. Katara accidentally froze Sokka's feet to the ship and later three Fire Nation soldiers with this technique,[9] before getting better control and utilizing it on Zuko[2] and a Fire Nation engineer.[10] Master Pakku also used this against several firebenders during the Siege of the North,[11] and Kya employed it against Zaheer.[12]

Flow as water: Waterbenders can use a jet of water to propel themselves smoothly around obstacles.[8]

Ice blade: Waterbenders can create a sword-like blade of ice. Ming-Hua used this technique to threaten a delivery truck driver in order to smuggle her and her companions out of Republic City[13] and again during her battle with Kya at the Northern Air Temple in an attempt to skewer the other woman.[14] Tonraq also used this in his battle with Zaheer on Laghima's Peak.[15]

Ice claws
Hama formed ice claws in a demonstration to Katara.

Ice claws: Shown by Hama, using ice claws involves the bender drawing water around their fingers and freezing it. They can also be sent forward, shooting them at an opponent.[3] A waterbender can also use this as an advantage; being small and unnoticeable, they can hide them in their sleeves just like Mai's weapons. Additionally, this technique uses little water and thus can be performed quickly using the condensation technique.

Ice column: Similar to the earth column technique used by earthbenders, a waterbender can shoot a pillar of ice up from the ground to knock their opponent off their feet. Unalaq used this technique during his duel with his brother, Tonraq.[16]

Ice disc: A waterbender can create a cylindrical column of ice and proceed to slice razor-sharp sections of it off and send them at an opponent. Katara used this technique against Master Pakku, employing discs that were sharp around the edges but also thin, as Master Pakku was able to break them with his wrists.[17]

Ice gauntlet: Waterbenders can cover their hand with a sheathe of ice.[8] Only a few waterbenders employ this technique, as they need to learn how to avoid frostbite while using it.[18]

Ice hook: Waterbenders, if creative enough, may form a hook out of ice which they can use to climb vertical surfaces. Ming-Hua bent ice hooks to climb up the walls of P'Li's prison while carrying her.[19] She also used an ice hook to take out a White Lotus sentry when breaking out of her prison.[20]

Ice line: Waterbenders can create lines of twisting ice columns to knock out their opponents. Unalaq, while in the Dark Avatar State, used an enhanced version of this technique to knock out Mako and Bolin during Harmonic Convergence.[21]

Ice projectiles: Waterbenders are able to rapidly shoot projectiles of ice at their opponents. The Northern Water Tribe Water Warriors used this to defend their tribe,[11] Katara while training with Aang, and Noa while attacking Gilak and the Southern Water Tribe nationalists.[22] Tarrlok did the same in his duel with Avatar Korra,[23] and Unalaq used the technique against Korra,[21] while Desna and Eska used it against Ming-Hua in the North Pole.[19] Tonraq,[19] Kya,[12] and Ming-Hua also have utilized this ability in combats.[24]

Katara creating an ice sled
Katara creating an ice sled.

Ice sled: Waterbenders can craft a sled out of ice and propel it forward with their bending at speeds that rival those achieved by motorized transportation, such as snowmobiles, ice shoes, and ice skateboards. This technique was first demonstrated by Katara[22] and later by Tonraq along with the Southern Water Tribe rebels,[16] Desna, and Eska.[21]

Ice wall/ice shield: Waterbenders are able to freeze water in front of them, creating a shield or even a large wall of ice. Katara performed this technique on numerous occasions during the Hundred Year War, while Malina did it later to protect herself and her brother from Gilak's forces.[22] Korra later made use of it to protect herself from a metalbending police officer who chased after her during her first time in Republic City,[25] as well as during her fight with the Dark Avatar.[21] The Northern Water Tribe Army created large ice walls to cover the Southern Water Tribe as well to they created ice barriers to push the civilians out of their way.[26] Unalaq also used this technique in his duel with Tonraq,[16] while Tonraq used it to protect himself from P'Li's combustion beams.[19] Kya also employed this move to defend herself and her brother Bumi from rocks launched by Ghazan during their battle at the Northern Air Temple.[14]

Katara stops her attack
Katara used an ice spear to threaten Yon Rha.

Ice spear: The ice spear is a waterbending move that involves freezing a stream of water into a spike and firing it at the intended target. This move was used by Pakku in his duel with Katara[17] and she later did it when she was about to strike down Yon Rha.[27] Korra also used this technique when she faced Amon.[28]

Iceberg spike: Waterbenders can shoot small shards of ice at their opponent, or cause a giant spike to protrude from a body of water. The Northern Water Tribe employs these as a primary defense of their homeland when enemy ships are sighted, and Hama and the Southern Water Tribe waterbenders immobilized a Fire Nation vessel by creating a large iceberg spike beneath it.[3] Katara also used this to freeze Sangok and later Zuko,[2] while Desna and Eska performed numerous iceberg spikes during their duel with Ming-Hua.[19] Korra also employed this technique to slow down Kuvira's enormous mecha suit.[29]

Phase change: Waterbenders also possess the ability to alter the physical state of the water they manipulate, between liquid, solid and gas, at will. Changing the phase of water allows for multiple techniques in the course of a battle, from encasing an opponent in ice to hiding behind a wall of mist. Ice and steam/fog can also be molded in a diverse range of shapes. Ice provides a degree of hard lethality since it can be molded into spikes or blades to pin down or impale opponents. Steam or mist can obscure a battlefield and mask movement. Waterbenders also possess the ability to breathe an icy mist that freezes water and other substances. Pakku used this technique in his duel with Katara.[17] Katara also used the technique to enhance her performance as the Painted Lady,[30] as well as with the waterbenders at the Foggy Swamp.[31] The move was later performed by one of the Red Monsoon Triad members.[32]

Quiet grip of ice: This technique allows a waterbender to use a bit of water on the ground nearby and to grab an opponent's foot in an icy hold.[33]

Kya dueling Zaheer
Kya used rings of water in her fight with Zaheer.

Rings of water: Skilled waterbenders can create one, two, or three rotating rings of water, in the sky, around their bodies.[34] This has both defensive and offensive capabilities, such as being used as a cannon. Siku and Sura demonstrated this technique as an aesthetic display of their waterbending abilities,[35] while Kya used this during her fight with Zaheer on Air Temple Island.[12]

Snowball: Waterbenders can create a snowball capable of fighting. The shape, size, and length are all determined by the waterbender's control, while more powerful benders can create larger balls. Sangok used this technique in his match with Katara, though she was able to redirect it back at him and freeze him.[2] Noa and Kam also used this technique against Katara, though she was able to redirect it back at them.[22] Siku and Sura also used this technique in the South Pole,[35] and a group of Southern Water Tribe kids as well against the Northern Water Tribe Army, and then against Korra, though she was able to block it.[26]

Slip over ice[8]: With a sufficient amount of water available, a skilled waterbender can cover a large area of the ground with ice, trapping their enemies' feet in ice while allowing them to slide around. The size and length are all determined by a waterbender's control, and more powerful benders can create larger floors. This technique was used by Katara while fighting the giant sea serpent[36] and by Pakku during the Order of the White Lotus' liberation of Ba Sing Se.[37] Tahno used a variation of this technique to only momentarily freeze the floor locally in order to cause Bolin to slip during a pro-bending match. Korra has also used this technique.[38] One of the Red Monsoon Triad members used the move to freeze the street,[32] and it has also been performed by Ahnah during a fight against an Earth Empire mecha suit.[39]

Stream the water[8]: Named by Katara, it is a move that draws water from a source that waterbenders move around their bodies.[40] A more advanced version demonstrated by Aang apparently involves "sinking and floating".[17] This move is thought to be used for basic training so that beginning waterbenders can get a "feel" for water, but it is, in reality, a useful move performed by waterbenders of every skill level, as demonstrated by Pakku, who used it as a pastime while awaiting the arrival of his pupils as well in unison with two students during a tribal gathering.[17] Young Noatak and Tarrlok also have demonstrated this move while training,[41] while Viper used it against Avatar Korra, although she was able to direct it back at him and freeze it around his head.[25] Hasook and Tahno have performed the technique during a pro-bending match,[38][42] and Katara,[2][17][40] Tarrlok,[43] Unalaq,[16] Tonraq,[19] and Ming-Hua have utilized it in combats.

Water ball: Similar to the bubble technique and the ice prison technique, a waterbender can trap their opponent in a ball of water. Katara used this technique to trap a fish,[44] Korra also used this to trap a smoke grenade and then froze it,[43] and later by Unalaq to trap Raava.[21] Ming-Hua also used the move to imprison Bolin.[24]

Water bracket: Skilled waterbenders can create a water bracket capable of cutting. This technique is a useful move performed by waterbenders of every skill level. Master Pakku used this technique against several firebenders while Katara used this technique against the swamp monster.[5] Tahno performed this move in a match against Avatar Korra.[38] Tarrlok also used it in his duel with Avatar Korra at the City Hall,[23] and Unalaq later against Korra, though she was able to block it.[45] Desna and Eska also used this technique against the Dark Spirits.[46]

Water bullet: The water bullet is a move where a waterbender bends a large amount of water and sends it in a forceful blow toward their target. It is similar to a water jet, but it is more for a quick use since the jet takes more concentration. It is basic yet useful because it takes little time to perform and has a significant effect on the target. Hama used this against Katara.[3]

Katara fighting Azula
Katara performed the water cloak technique to fight against Azula.

Water cloak: A waterbender can use their water as a form of armor with tentacle-like arms. The bender can use these arms to grab objects or enemies, whip enemies, blast enemies with water, and freeze them. If a waterbender has less water available, they can simply form the arms instead of the entire cloak. This technique was first shown by Katara while she dueled against Azula in the Crystal Catacombs[47] and again when she was on board the Southern Raiders frigate.[27] Unalaq also used this against Korra in the Southern Water Tribe prison, and Korra later did against members of the Northern Water Tribe while breaking her father out of ship.[45] The technique was also used by both Korra and Unalaq in their fight during Harmonic Convergence.[21] Both Kya and Tonraq later used it during their duels with Zaheer at Air Temple Island and Laghima's peak, respectively.[15][12] Ming-Hua mastered this technique to the point that she could mold the ends of the tentacles into any shape, such as a claw or a hook, as well as only locally freeze the ends while retaining the mobility of the tentacle as a whole.[20]

Water filtering: When working in concert with an earthbender, a waterbender can purify polluted water. The waterbender suspends the polluted water in the air while the earthbender removes the pollutants.[48]

Water jab: Waterbenders can surround their fist in water and use the force of the stream to enhance a water-boxing punch.[49] This move was used by Tahno in a match against the Fire Ferrets.[38]

Water jet: High-pressure jets can be used to force opponents back or even blast clean through a target if focused enough. Water jets are primarily used if the user has the intent of severely hurting their opponents. It was seen being performed by Aang against a pirate,[40] the Northern Water Tribe employs this as a defense of their homeland when enemy are on their land,[11] later by Katara against a firebender in the Southern Raiders frigate.[27] Unalaq also used this technique against Mako and Bolin,[21] and Kya used it against Ming-Hua.[14]

Water knife: Waterbenders can create a fast, cutting swoop of water that can cut through vulnerable materials.[49]

Water lashing:[50] The ability to shape water into a super-sharp edge or point for a split-second, enabling a waterbender to cut through metal, wood and stone. Aang and Katara used this technique to sabotage the giant Fire Nation drill assaulting Ba Sing Se.[10]

Spinning the serpent
Aang and Katara used water manipulation to subdue a giant sea serpent.

Water manipulation: Almost all forms of waterbending involve moving and shaping a body of water to the waterbender's desire. By simply levitating a large mass of water, waterbenders can move water anywhere they wish, even parting it under the surface of a lake or sea, allowing them to walk along the bottom of a basin without the need to swim. These large bodies of water can also be used as weapons, either by shaping them into gigantic whips, swung repeatedly at a target as a snake-like body, formed momentarily into a razor-sharp edge that can cut through even metal, or simply dropped onto an opponent to smother them or put out a fire. On the sea or ocean, waterbending can be used to create giant maelstroms. Aang and Katara used this to set off a giant sea serpent.[36]

Water pressure manipulation: Waterbenders are also able to manipulate water pressure, allowing them to use water to grasp other objects or cut through without simply parting around them. Water can be used as a semi-solid while being able to move and flow like a liquid. Water can be pressurized to such a level where it can slice through metal.[10] Waterbenders can also use this to avoid sinking in water, effectively allowing them to walk on water, as demonstrated by Katara multiple times.

Water ring: A skilled waterbender can create a ring of water around their body which can be used for both defense and offense, such as shooting ice shards or sending water whips at their opponent. Pakku used this technique in his duel with Katara, and Kya used it in her duel with Zaheer[12] and twice against Ming-Hua.[14]

Water rope: A waterbender can create a rope capable of grabbing objects or enemies, as well as whipping enemies. This technique is similar to the water cloak. It was used by Aang in the Avatar State to catch Ozai.[51]

Katara and Zuko fight
Katara used a water shield to defend against Zuko's attacks.

Water wall/water shield: Water can be molded into a variety of shapes and can be used to deflect an attack, trap opponents in a viscous body, reshaped and propelled at attackers before they can recover, or solidified into a shield of ice. This diversity and ability to swiftly change to suit the situation is what makes the waterbender's defense so adaptable. Although usually protective, the shield needs some type of compression or else it will not be effective. This is demonstrated when Katara was fighting Zuko at the Spirit Oasis and her quickly-made shield could not block the fire blast.[2]

Water whip: The water whip is a commonly used move that involves creating a lashing tendril of water to swipe at an opponent. The shape, size, and length are all determined by a waterbender's control, and more powerful benders can create larger whips, or ones of greater finesse. The whip can be sharpened into a blade that can slice through metal with relative ease,[52] Aang,[40] Katara,[53] Malina, Noa, Kam,[22] Hasook, Korra,[42] Tarrlok,[23] Tonraq,[54] Unalaq,[45] Desna, Eska,[16] and Kya[55] have demonstrated the ability to create water whips.

Water kick: Waterbenders can use kicking motions to send streams of water towards a target. Korra first demonstrated this during her first Pro-bending match, conjuring a powerful stream of water to knock an opposing player off the ring. Eska used this technique to destroy Korra's motorboat while she and Desna were pursuing her. Other waterbenders are very skilled practitioners of this skill and more powerful benders can create larger streams.

Wave: By moving a large mass of water without separating it from its original source, advanced waterbenders can create waves of nearly any size. They do this by using an upward movement that raises the source, which they subsequently send away in their desired direction. This can be used to sweep opponents away or even as a form of transport, with the bender surfing on the crest of the wave. This same process can be used to propel waterborne crafts.[52] Pakku used this technique during his duel with Katara in the Northern Water Tribe.[17] Aang used it while in the Avatar State against the Fire Nation ships.[11] Katara,[56] Eska,[45] Unalaq,[16] Kya,[12] and Ming-Hua[14] also proved to be skilled practitioners of this technique.[14]

Waterbending master level
The mark of a master waterbender is the ability to swiftly change from one state of water to another and rapidly switch techniques during combat, keeping the opponent off guard while constantly adapting to the enemy as demonstrated by Master Pakku. For example, he deflected a stream of water away from himself, froze it, and used it to slide behind Katara and counterattacked.[17]

Katara using the bubble technique
Katara used the bubble technique to contain a supply of air for her and Appa while traveling underwater.

Bubble: Capable waterbenders are able to cross large bodies of water by creating a bubble around themselves and their fellow travelers, maintaining a supply of air for their journey. The technique was first used by Aang and Katara to cross the Serpent's Pass[36] and later by Katara on two occasions so that she and Appa could submerge.[27][31] It was also used by Korra several times to transport herself and others under the surface of Yue Bay while traveling to and from Air Temple Island.[42][41][57]

Crushing grip of seas: This is a rare technique, where a waterbender can throw a tendril of water to wrap around a foe's limbs, holding them in place with a very strong grip.[8]

Ice cover: A master waterbender can create an ice cover to cloak their opponent, and resembles the ice prison. Tonraq used this technique to cover a dark spirit.[32]

Ice dome: An advanced technique, as demonstrated by Katara while fighting against Zuko in the Spirit Oasis, a waterbender may surround a foe in a sphere of water and freeze it, trapping their opponent inside.[2] Alternatively, a waterbender can use the dome as a protective shell around themselves. For example, Katara once surrounded herself in an ice dome after falling off Appa to remain afloat in a fast-flowing river and avoid injuring herself against the rocks when she went over a waterfall.[58]

Ice drill: By turning the tip into ice, waterbenders control massive amounts of water into a spiraled frozen drill. This technique was first demonstrated by Unalaq, while he tried to open the Northern spirit portal.[59] Ming-Hua also used this to break P'Li out of her cell.[19]

Ice ladder: This technique can be used for quick scaling of vertical surfaces when no other options are available. Katara created an ice ladder to rescue Hakoda and Earth King Kuei when the Bridge of No Return collapsed beneath them.[35]

Katara freezes Azula
Katara used an ice prison to lock down Azula during the Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai.

Ice prison: This rare technique covers an opponent in a prison made of ice.[8] By finely controlling the position of the person within, this technique can restrict the motions of an opponent's hands, thus rendering them powerless. Master Pakku used this move on several firebenders[11] and Katara incapacitated Azula during Sozin's Comet with this.[51] Tonraq used this technique to trap two Northern soldiers, before he was incapacitated himself in a similar manner by Unalaq.[16] Desna and Eska also used this technique to trap Mako and Bolin,[21] and Ming-Hua demonstrated mastery over it, as she used two ice pillars to imprison Desna and Eska.[19]

Ice ramp: Waterbenders can manipulate ice as a means of short transportation for themselves or others. Katara used this when training with Aang and Toph,[48] as well as during the Battle for Yu Dao.[60] Korra used this technique to craft a pathway to topple a snowmobile in order to save Unalaq[26] and later to transport herself during her fight with Hundun and his dark spirits.[61] Tonraq also used this technique during a fight with a dark spirit,[32] as well as a manner of quick transportation during his duel with Unalaq.[16] Similarly, waterbenders can also shift snow and water to create stairs of ice in order to improve mobility in snow.[62]

Ice tunneling: Waterbenders are able to swim through thick ice with the same ease as through water, allowing them to surprise their foes. The technique was only seen to have been performed twice, once by a waterbender from the Southern Water Tribe in a flashback of Hama's and again by Korra, who used it to escape from her compound.[3][25]

Maelstrom: In a large body of water, a waterbender can create a gigantic whirlpool. This technique was executed by Aang and Katara while fighting the serpent.[36]

Mist-stepping: A variation of the dust-stepping and jet-stepping techniques used by earthbenders and firebenders, respectively, a fast waterbender can use tiny pillars of ice to quickly scale a building. This technique was invented by the Flying Opera Company.[63]

Multiple water whips: An advanced waterbending move similar to the single water whip, except it deals with more than one whip, usually four or five. This technique seems to be able to inflict a large amount of damage. It was used by Katara against Azula.[51] Unalaq also used this technique in his duel with Tonraq.[16]

Ming-Hua's multiple arms
Ming-Hua used a variant of the octopus form in her duel with Kya: rather than forming the multiple arms around her, she created them attached directly to her body.

Octopus form: A body of water formed around the user into multiple whip-like tendrils which can be used to grasp or strike an opponent or to intercept incoming attacks. This technique was first demonstrated by Aang during his training with Katara,[64] who later used the form herself while fighting the Dai Li.[47] Ming-Hua used a variation of the form in her duel with Kya at the Northern Air Temple[14] and against Mako prior to her death.[65]

Partial ice whip: Waterbenders can take hold of the end of an opponent's water whip and locally freeze the opposite end in order to trap their opponent and pull them in closer. Korra demonstrated this technique in her fight against the Dark Avatar.[21]

Razor rings: An experienced waterbender can create multiple simultaneous water rings capable of cutting. Katara used this against the swamp monster.[5]

Suspending rain: When it is raining, a very skillful waterbender can suspend the rain, keeping all of the rain droplets within a vicinity frozen in place for a short time. This was done by Katara when confronting Yon Rha.[27]

Water blast: A waterbender can bend a large volume of water and send it forward as a large wave-like blast, pushing opponents away, functioning as a scaled up water bullet. Korra used this technique during her first match in the Pro-bending Arena,[42] and Unalaq utilized it to shatter Bolin's earth wall, and again while ambushing him and Mako by the spirit portal alongside Desna and Eska.[21]

Water cloak: This rare defensive move allows a waterbender to surround themselves with their element. This allows the waterbender to easily throw water into their environment in subsequent attacks.[8]

Water drill: A high-pressure, rotating column of water. Capable of exerting a significant amount of pressure upon a solid surface, that allows the action of a drill. The move takes mastery of waterbending since the motions to create a constantly twisting body of water requires bending skill. This technique was first demonstrated by Taqukaq[66] and later by Kya during her fight with Zaheer.[12]

Water gliding: Waterbending masters can glide on water at high speeds, in addition to riding on foreign objects with the same purpose. This technique was first used during Team Avatar's crossing of the Serpent's Pass, when Katara formed an ice surfboard and increased her speed in order to effectively freeze the serpent's midsection without being hit.[36] She used it a second time to cross the lake to Jang Hui.[30] Aang used this in his fight against Ozai to flee from the Fire Lord's attacks after being knocked off a cliff.[37] Amon also used this ability to escape and surpass the speed of Mako's fire blasts.[67] During their fight with Korra, Desna and Eska encased their feet with ice to allow them to slide across the water.[68] Korra also used this technique to ride a wave and cross the water when she was trying to stop two thieves at a small fishing town.[69]

Water pinwheel: This move involves the user moving a large mass of water and spinning it vertically around them. This was demonstrated by Hama while blocking Katara's attacks.[3]

Water slide: Dubbed by Sokka, this technique involves controlling a whirlpool-like pillar of water similar to the water spout, except instead of enveloping and levitating the waterbender who created it, the slide wraps around other people. Katara utilized this technique to catch Sokka, Satoru, and Loban and safely deposit them on the ground when they fell from General Old Iron's mask.[70]

Water sphere shield: A waterbender can surround themselves in a sphere of water to deflect attacks and return fire,[49] the shape and size all dependent on how much water there is available. Katara used this technique to frighten Yon Rha.[27] Tarrlok also used this technique in his fight with Avatar Korra in the City Hall.[23]

Water spout
Pakku used a water spout to battle firebenders.

Water spout, water vortex, or water tower: This high-level technique involves controlling a whirlpool-like pillar of water, rotating it and directing its movements at the same time, making it easier for the user to dodge attacks. In accordance with the water spout's constantly shifting and coiling movements, it forms a giant snake of water around the lower body, elevating them from the surface of the water. First demonstrated by Aang,[9] Pakku used this technique to ward off several firebenders during the Siege of the North,[11] and Katara performed a minor version of this to bring Aang up and out of the Crystal Catacombs[47] and to escape from Gilak and the Southern Water Tribe nationalists.[22] Korra,[68] Amon,[67] Unalaq,[21] and Ming-Hua[14] also proved to be skilled practitioners of this technique. The water spout has a limited height, however, depending on the amount of water fueling it.[38]

Avatar level waterbending
Ice fissure: Avatars are able to use waterbending to split frozen ground by bending the water mixed with the earth. Unalaq used this technique after merging with Vaatu to form a deep chasm and trap Korra within, intending to crush her as he brought both sides of the fissure back together.[21]

Remote waterbending: Avatars can use waterbending from distances which a waterbender would not normally be able to access. While in combat with Ozai, Aang went into the Avatar State and pulled water in from the sea toward himself to make part of his elemental sphere. After defeating Ozai, Aang raised the tides of the sea to put out the fire at Wulong Forest caused by Ozai and his airships.[51]

Kuruk waterbending
Avatar Kuruk used his waterbending to create a large wave.

Tsunami: Since they can control larger amounts of water, Avatars are capable of creating and controlling water bodies of far greater size and scale, including causing massive tsunamis, at will. The technique was first demonstrated by Avatar Kuruk as he created a large wave to ride on.[71] Later, Aang and Princess Yue created a large tsunami that brought Aang to safety on Crescent Island.[56] Korra used a variation of this technique to create a localized wave that spun the Northern battleships out of the way to allow Varrick's yacht to pass through their blockade.[26]

Water compression: An Avatar in the Avatar State has enough power over water to compress its volume, compacting several thousands of gallons into a small volume. Aang did so when he created his elemental sphere while preparing to pursue Ozai.[51]

Special techniques
Many of the following techniques are guided by the principle that waterbenders may manipulate any solution, organism or object where water is present.

Ming-Hua subdues Bolin and Mako
Ming-Hua was able to waterbend despite her lack of arms.

Armless waterbending: Proficient waterbenders can control water without the use of limbs, relying only on the torso to generate enough movement to manipulate a medium. With this technique, waterbenders such as Ming-Hua can create water-like appendages as makeshift arms and even turn the entire body into an ice drill by generating enough momentum.[19]

Bloodbending: Bloodbending is a specialized sub-skill and a rare variation of waterbending,[72] a sinister application of the principle that water is present in every living organism, thus making them bendable objects themselves. This technique is referred to as the highest level of waterbending.[73] By definition, bloodbending is a technique that allows a bender to enforce their will to an organism. Initially, it was thought that bloodbending could only be done during the full moon, where waterbenders are at their most powerful. However, it was proven that complete mastery of bloodbending would not require a full moon to practice the ability, when Yakone, and later his sons, Noatak and Tarrlok, had employed the technique without the aid of the full moon.[57]

The technique was invented by Hama during her time as a Fire Nation prisoner following the Southern Water Tribe raids. She came to a realization that living things, animals and humans included, contain large volumes of water, and thus can be bent.[3] Later, the technique was outlawed following the Hundred Year War, with Katara leading the motion for it to be declared illegal.[57]

Body fluid manipulation: As the human body contains a high percentage of water, waterbenders can manipulate various fluids within the body, some with more difficulty than others. Bending blood, for example, typically requires the presence of the full moon, when a waterbender's power is at its peak,[3] unless the bender is born from a bloodline of rare skill, as was the case for Yakone's family.[28][57] Altering the temperature of water within the body similarly demands a high degree of skill, Atuat and Kyoshi only able to perform the technique because they possessed enough raw power and made physical contact with the body.[74][75] Using water as a catalyst to redirect energy paths within the body, meanwhile, is more widespread,[17] Katara even managing to perform the ability instinctively after Aang accidentally burned her hands.[4] Other bodily fluids, such as sweat[48] or the water vapor in breath,[6][7] have also been bent with ease, appearing to be limited more so by a waterbender's resourcefulness than their raw power, as Hama noted when Katara revealed that she was able to create and bend her own sweat in order to escape from a Fire Fountain City prison cell.[3] Relying on this resourcefulness, Katara has additionally demonstrated the ability to bend liquid trapped in a person's lungs, extracting the water Aang accidentally aspirated when the unagi knocked him unconscious.[76]

Cloudbending or cloud manipulation: By working together, a waterbender and airbender can easily manipulate clouds, which are made of air and water, to create various shapes. In one particular instance, cloudshaping was used to provide a message to nearby villagers of an erupting volcano.[77] It was later used by Aang and his friends to disguise their flights on Appa while moving about the Fire Nation.[78]

Condensation: Not only can skilled waterbenders condense clouds into a usable source of water when they are within close range of one,[79] but they also can condense invisible water vapor right out of the air.[3] Although, due to the limited quantities of water present in the air, as a mere 1% at most of the earth's atmosphere is water vapor, the amount of water extracted from the air is quite minimal. Favorable environment and climatic conditions increase the amount of water one can remove from the air.

Katara heals her hands
Katara discovered her healing abilities after being burnt accidentally by Aang.

Healing: Waterbenders can sometimes use a unique sub-skill: the ability to heal injuries by redirecting energy paths, or chi, throughout the body, using water as a catalyst. Waterbenders can use their abilities to heal by surrounding a sick or injured person with water, which glows during the process.[4] Certain highly skilled healers are also able to lower body temperature to such a level that all processes are slowed down, including death itself, as demonstrated by Atuat. However, this technique can also be employed in a more sinister way, as showcased by Kyoshi, who used it to kill by freezing her opponent's heart and lungs.[75] When infused with spiritual knowledge, a variation of this technique can be used to calm angry spirits, as demonstrated by Makittuq,[80] Unalaq, and Korra.[81] The use of healing was generally taught to female waterbenders of the Northern Water Tribe, who were not allowed to study combative forms of waterbending prior to the end of the Hundred Year War.[17] Katara is known to be the best healer in the world. With the help of Spirit Oasis water, she was able to heal Aang and resurrect him.[47]

Plantbending: A member of the Foggy Swamp Tribe, Huu, illustrated that talented waterbenders can manipulate plant life. Plantbending enables members of the swamp to control and manipulate every form of plant life, from the highly water-saturated vines and roots found within the swamplands to seaweed from the ocean floor, by bending the ample amount of water within them. They are also able to to rapidly compress and replace the plant mass of the flora they bend, as the cell tissues are more versatile than those of an animal.[5] During a full moon plantbenders can manipulate bigger plants such as large trees.[82] Misu also used plantbending to attack Team Avatar.[83]

Draining the fire lilies
Hama bent water from fire lilies.

Going further, a skilled waterbender is able to separate and completely extract the water from plants for more effective utilization just as they are able to separate the water from mud, sand, and even polluted river systems, etc. In the case of plant life, this process will leave behind the withered remains of all the affected plant life or even making them collapse in the case of large trees. The degree of skill in manipulating plant life depends on the experience of the bender and whether or not a full moon is present. Katara and Hama extracted the water from large trees with relatively no difficulty during their battle under the full moon. Simpler and smaller forms of plant life, such as grass, flowers and seaweed, can be bent with relative ease, with or without a full moon.[3]

Solutions: It has been shown that waterbenders can manipulate any mass of liquid consisting of some water. For example, Kirima bent wine and froze it on the floor to make policemen slip.[84] Later, Katara bent the contents of the abbey's perfume vats.[85] She used waterbending to stir and ladle stew into bowls, to spill ink out of a bowl, and to bend the water inside mud as well. Katara halted the flow of the slurry on the back of the drill to prevent Ty Lee from following her, and, with Toph's aid, they were able to push the slurry back into the drill. Katara was seen bending mud when she and Toph ended up fighting when they were supposed to be training Aang, and she bent soup right into Appa's mouth from a pot.[48] Katara bent ink to make a Fire Nation official leave the room so she and Zuko could search through the files about the current location of the Southern Raiders.[27] Aang thought of using "gluebending" to defeat Ozai, suggesting that a waterbender can bend glue.[86] Maolo was able to bend the water in paint, being able to forge paintings from noble families while the originals were auctioned off at Ba Sing Se's black market.[87]

Steam manipulation: A technique that allows waterbenders to manipulate steam, and can also be used to manipulate fog or moisture. It can be used to freeze people or objects or to create cover. Katara turned steam to ice to freeze an engineer of the Fire Nation drill in place, made good use of the technique when she created a thick cloud of steam to conceal a ship from the enemy[56] and when she surrounded herself in a fog to create an eerie atmosphere while pretending to be a river spirit.[30] Korra also made use of this technique while infiltrating Amon's rally, using steam from nearby pipes to provide cover for Mako.[88]

Enhanced waterbending
Waterbending is greatly strengthened and enhanced during the night, due to its lunar affinity. During a full moon in particular, waterbending is greatly enhanced, to the point where a single waterbender can overpower multiple opponents with relative ease.[2] Bloodbending was largely thought to be possible only under a full moon. As an additional note, waterbending abilities are not enhanced during a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the moon is directly in front of the sun. While the moon blocks the sunlight, all of the light from the sun shines on the far side of the moon. The side of the moon is completely dark, meaning that the moon's phase is in the new moon phase. During a solar eclipse, the moon is always in the new moon stage. Since a full moon strengthens and amplifies a waterbender's waterbending abilities to numerous levels, a solar eclipse does not enhance a waterbender's abilities.[89] Finally, waterbenders will become stronger when they are near their homelands.[90]

Opposing bending art
Waterbending is the antithetical bending art to firebending, though it is similar in its need for inner discipline, breath control, and a strong connection to external forces. Firebenders use quick strong punches and kicks to shoot fire, while waterbenders use slow movements and elegant turns and spins to return the momentum of the opponents' attacks with blasts of water. Firebenders attack first, while waterbenders wait and turn their target's attacks against them.

Like all the bending arts, waterbending is balanced out as to not be more or less powerful than the other arts. It is the skill and prowess of the user that determines victory. In the case of waterbending however, a waterbender's ability to perform all of the waterbending they are capable of is significantly dependent on the amount of water available.

Avatar Roku, born a firebender, considered learning waterbending as "especially challenging" and called mastering the four elements "bitter work". Even when in combat situations, Roku favored firebending, earthbending and airbending above waterbending, to the point where he did not use waterbending to fight a volcano, despite being surrounded by water.[66]

Iroh used waterbending philosophy when developing lightning redirection, a technique used to prevent harm from lightning.[1] Zuko was taught the technique and both of them have been shown using it effectively against powerful opponents. Zuko later taught it to Aang, who was also able to use the technique.[86]

Although they are opposing bending arts, both waterbending and firebending can manipulate external thermal energy.

Additionally, both waterbending and firebending can affect the environment if the bender loses their temper, as seen when Katara cracked ice while screaming at Sokka,[91] and when Zuko was having a tense discussion with Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee.[92]

Weapons
Water skin
Katara often carried a water skin with her as a source of water.

The only known times a weapon has been used with waterbending was when Avatar Kyoshi used her fans to create a wave[93] and when Aang used his staff to freeze water.[53] However, many waterbenders carry water skins of various sizes to provide them with a source of water in places where it is scarce, such as deserts and urban locations.

Styles
There are four waterbending styles known to exist in the Avatar universe, namely the Northern style, Southern style, Foggy Swamp style, and pro-bending style.[42][94] Due to the circumstances of the Hundred Year War, the Southern style was nearly extinct, with only Hama left as the only Southern Water Tribe waterbending master during Avatar Aang's time to be fully trained in waterbending. However, Hama passed on all her knowledge to Katara before they became enemies.[3]

As the Foggy Swamp Tribe is an offshoot of the Southern Water Tribe, Foggy Swamp style may have first developed from the Southern style, but throughout the intervening generations it has evolved into its own distinct style.[5]

Northern and Southern style
The Northern Water Tribe developed the first style of waterbending for use in their home at the North Pole. When the Southern Water Tribe formed in the South Pole, they developed a slightly different style that nonetheless is similar to the Northern style.

The traditional waterbending styles of the Northern and Southern Water Tribes focus on graceful, fluid movements for their attacks. These styles frequently make use of switching the state of water from liquid to ice and snow. It is with this technique that the waterbenders built their large polar cities. The Northern waterbending style seems to traditionally perform more defensive, strategic, and architectural techniques in waterbending,[17] while the Southern waterbending style seems to be more aggressive and offensive than the Northern style.[3]

Foggy Swamp style
Foggy Swamp style is the waterbending style used by the Foggy Swamp Tribe of the Earth Kingdom.

Due waterbending
The style of waterbending used in the Foggy Swamp was different to the other water tribes.

Instead of the fluid, graceful movements of the other two waterbending styles, they keep a rigid and straight stance, possibly reflecting the usually stagnant nature of water in their swamp homelands, and use stiff and circular arm movements to move water like a propeller. This style seems to be effective in moving the tribe's boats.[5]

They do not appear to use ice or snow attacks as often as their polar cousins, possibly due to the lack of ice in their environment. However, an exception was seen during the Day of Black Sun, when one member used ice to patch a hole in one of the submarines.[31] One of the swamp's tribesmen, Huu, was able to develop plantbending.[5] It is unlikely that other polar waterbenders were aware of this technique, though Hama did not express surprise when learning of it, preferring to remove the water from plants rather than manipulating the plant.[3]

The battle capabilities of this style seem to be accurate, since Tho, Due, and the other Swamp waterbenders used this unique style in battle, making noticeable foot movements in addition to moving their arms in the desired direction to shield themselves from harm before stepping and performing an elegant punching motion to attack.[31]

Pro-bending style
After seventy years, the art of waterbending changed greatly. The benders began to adapt and develop new techniques. One particular change was the development of pro-bending. Because of the hindering rules of this game, waterbenders' styles adapted to match. For instance, waterbenders are restricted from using continuous streams of water. To compensate, they have modernized waterbending to mainly include short blasts and blocks.

One noticeable change in the art is a more frequent use of the lower body in bending. Originally, the lower body was not significantly used in waterbending. However, pro-bending has enabled some waterbenders, such as Avatar Korra, to use high arching kicks to direct streams of water.

Another new technique of waterbending is that it has also somewhat moved away from traditional grace and more into the quickness of the attack. Reminiscent of firebending, the waterbenders often use sharp, quick, boxer-like punches when bending, allowing the players to stay light on their feet and able to dodge incoming attacks on the field.

The battle capabilities of this technique are far more diverse than that of the other techniques. This is mainly due to fighting being the main purpose of pro-bending. Korra has been seen fighting outside the ring effectively, implementing her pro-bending style waterbending against a variety of opponents.[95]

Weaknesses
External water source: A waterbender gains a significant advantage or disadvantage over other benders depending on the amount of water in the vicinity. Enemies are able to take advantage of this by driving them away from water sources. As a result, traveling waterbenders often carry a water skin with them at all times. Master waterbenders are able to extract water from plants, ultimately killing the plants, and even condense water vapor out of thin air.[3]

Hot temperatures: Hot temperatures can make a waterbender weaker. The heat can reap away their water sources so that no water can be bent in contrast to firebenders, who are stronger in hot temperatures. This was demonstrated by where Ming-Hua's prison was built: directly over a volcano.[20]

Binding: Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on the movement of the bender's arms, quite the opposite of earthbending which mostly uses the lower body. This leaves the waterbender vulnerable when they are bound at the hands or has had the flow of chi-blocked in the arms.[7] Waterbending can be performed with the lower body, such as when Katara anchored her feet in ice during her fight against Master Pakku,[17] or when she created a piece of ice to use as a surfboard when fighting a giant sea serpent.[36] Another lower body technique is outlined on the waterbending scroll stolen by Katara, from which both she and Aang learned a technique named the water whip.[40] However, Katara used her feet when she fought the guard earthbenders, in the Royal Palace, performing a larger than normal water whip.[53] Hama also briefly tells Katara how the Fire Nation prison guards bound the waterbenders' arms each time they were given water to drink, emphasizing their helplessness.[3]

Red moon
A lunar eclipse occurred when Admiral Zhao captured and subsequently killed the Moon Spirit.

Lunar eclipse: Another waterbending weakness is its dependence on the moon. Although waterbenders gain power from the moon, with waterbending at its zenith during full moons, the moon's absence during a lunar eclipse results in a complete loss of waterbending ability.[11]

Emotional state: A waterbender's power comes from the internal life energy, chi. Due to this, a waterbender's power is connected to their present emotional state. If an inexperienced waterbender were to lose their temper, their waterbending force is intensified, but in turn, control is lost; this was demonstrated by Katara when she lost her temper against Sokka and inadvertently cracked an iceberg.[91] Although this has the potential to be quite dangerous in a waterbender with little to no training, it also serves as a boon to a bender with proper training and experience, as well as balance over their emotions.[96]

Lightning: Impure water is a natural conductor of electricity. Considering how many waterbending techniques involve a physical connection to the water itself, the bender is left vulnerable to a lightning strike. Mako was able to exploit this weakness and defeat Ming-Hua.[65]

Overcoming weakness
Some of the standard waterbending weaknesses can be overcome by skilled waterbending masters. In environments without water, a master can pull water particles out of clouds, air, and even out of living organisms such as plants and trees. The drawback is that if the water is removed from a living organism, it will wither and die.[3] Water can also be obtained from a master's own body if need be, from sweat or saliva.[48] The amount of water able to be removed from the air will vary depending on weather conditions. As only a small proportion of the planet's atmosphere contains gaseous water, these amounts would be limited even at the best of times. However, the amount of water can be sufficient to form a usable weapon, such as ice claws, which do not need a lot of water to form.[3] Furthermore, binding does not work on waterbenders who mastered the ability to waterbend using the lower body and/or without any arms, such as Ming-Hua.

Elemental symbol
Waterbending emblem
The waterbending symbol contains a stylized ocean wave.

The symbol for water and waterbending is a circle comprising a stylized rightward-facing ocean wave with three spiral crests breaking over three wavy diagonal lines representing water.[1] It also shows how the Moon and Ocean Spirits work together, with the moon symbolized by the circular border and the Ocean Spirit symbolized by the picture of an ocean. The symbol is featured in connection with Northern Water Tribe spirituality and on the pendant worn by Katara, originally carved by Master Pakku for her grandmother as an engagement present.[17]

Spirituality and waterbending
"The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves ... Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon, our life comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance."
―Princess Yue.[2]
Tui and La
The Moon and the Ocean Spirits circle each other in an eternal dance, balancing one another and their powers.

Like the moon controlling the tides, waterbenders move water using their chi to mimic gravitational pull by choosing how to direct their energy utilizing two jings, which in turn work to push and pull the water that is being controlled. Because of this lunar sympathy, a waterbender's power is stronger at night, at its absolute zenith during a full moon, and lost during a lunar eclipse. A waterbender's power is also enhanced during the rain, for obvious reasons. Furthermore, a waterbender's power is strongest when they are situated in colder climates, during the winter,[97] or near their native polar homelands.

Legend further elaborates that Tui, meaning "push", the Moon Spirit, and its symbiotic partner La, meaning "pull", the Ocean Spirit, gave up their immortality to be a part of the mortal world. In fact, these spirits exist in the physical forms of two koi fish eternally circling one another in a pond, in the highly spiritual oasis, in the capital city of the Northern Water Tribe.[11]

The "push and pull" relationship between the moon's gravity and the water's inertia is represented by Yin and Yang. The Moon Spirit koi is white, with a black forehead marking, and the Ocean Spirit koi is black, with a white forehead marking, mimicking the two primal forces.[2]

Without the equilibrium of these two spiritual aspects, waterbenders lose their powers. This was illustrated when Tui's mortal form was killed by Admiral Zhao during the Fire Nation's siege of the Northern Water Tribe. The moon disappeared from the sky, the balance of the world was upset, and the waterbenders defending the North Pole were rendered powerless.[11]

Koizilla destroys the Navy
Aang and the Ocean Spirit wiped out the Fire Nation Navy.

The Fire Nation's invading fleet was subsequently defeated when the Avatar, Aang, acted as a literal avatar of La and combined to form a gigantic water creature that swept the Fire Nation forces out to sea. Balance was restored when Princess Yue, who had received a part of Tui's life force at birth to prevent her immediate death, returned that force and sacrificed herself so that Tui might live.[11]

Waterbending emphasizes symbiosis: acting in concert with one's environment and guiding it, rather than avoiding, controlling, or working against it. In the Foggy Swamp Tribe, waterbenders were shown to be especially attuned to the environment, as one of its members, Huu, was able to achieve enlightenment by meditating under a tree in the heart of the swamp and connecting with it the same way it is connected with the rest of the swamp, as it is a superior organism.[5]

Connection
Waterbending is based on a style of taijiquan (also known as t'ai chi ch'uan, or tai chi for short), specifically the Yang and Chen style, as well as a style developed by Chinese martial artist Gu Ruzhang.[98][99] It is an internal Chinese martial art that features slow movements and elegant forms that evoke the feel of flowing water.

Like taijiquan, a waterbender's main advantage is the ease with which they can control their opponent, not simply harming them. Both arts were influenced by ancient healing practices; people would channel their "energy paths" within themselves to areas of the body where healing was necessary. They also share a specific focus: body alignment, breath, and visualization. Finally, a waterbender can typically find that softness and breathing are more effective for their ability than hard aggression, just as a practitioner of taijiquan does.[100] In taijiquan, the qi must flow through the body like water, and the energy is driven from the internal balance and by breathing.

The pro-bending style is more reminiscent of mixed martial arts fighting, as seen with the wide variety of techniques used in the sport to waterbend.

related to Waterbending.
Learning to swim is a way to master Waterbending.[102]
Disciplines stated to having relation with waterbending are playing the flute, clarinet or any instrument that requires smooth, rhythmic breathing, and coordinated movement. This also includes bowling, surfing, and scuba diving.[102]
More waterbenders are born during the winter season than in any other season.[103]
Waterbending is the first bending art shown in the franchise; it was first showcased in the opening sequence and subsequently used by Katara while fishing with Sokka in the South Pole.[91]
Waterbending is the only bending art not to originate from animals, as waterbenders learned from observing the push and pull of the Moon and Ocean. However, the Moon and Ocean Spirits took the form of koi fish, thus making waterbending's original source somewhat similar to those of the other bending arts.
According to "Avatar Extras", during the production of the "The Puppetmaster", the technique Hama used to temporarily hold Katara was jokingly referred to as the "Stop Hitting Yourself" technique.
The single water whip technique involves identical movements to a form in Tai Chi known as the single whip form.[40]
In the Greek translation of Avatar: The Last Airbender, waterbending was usually translated as Νεροδάμασμα (Nerodamasma). However, in the last episodes of the first book, the translation was changed to Υδατοδάμασμα (Idatodamasma). Both words mean "subdue water", though the difference lies in that νερό (nero) means water in modern Greek and ύδωρ (ydor) in Ancient Greek, making Υδατοδάμασμα (Idatodamasma) a more formal translation. In The Legend of Korra, it is instead translated as κάμψη νερού (kampsi Nerou), meaning "bending of water".
To coincide with the airing of Book Two: Spirits, Microsoft released waterbending as one of three bending forms available for a player's custom Avatar on Xbox Live.
On the waterbending scroll, the word waterbending is written in Chinese as 截水神功, which can be translated as "The Divine Ability to Halt Water".[40]
The sound effects for bending ice in Avatar: The Last Airbender were created primarily using lettuce.[104]
