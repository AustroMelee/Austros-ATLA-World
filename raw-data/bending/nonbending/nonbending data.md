#### Roles and Significance of Nonbenders
Nonbenders contribute to the Avatar universe through various means, often compensating for their lack of bending with other abilities:
- **Martial Arts and Chi-Blocking**: Characters like Suki, Ty Lee, and The Lieutenant use nonbending combat techniques, with chi-blocking being a notable skill to disable benders temporarily. This is particularly evident in the Equalists' movement in LOK, where nonbenders like Hiroshi Sato and The Lieutenant fight for equality.
- **Technological Expertise**: Asami Sato and Varrick exemplify nonbenders' advancements in technology, with Asami taking over Future Industries and Varrick inventing for Varrick Global Industries. This reflects the industrialization theme in LOK.
- **Leadership and Politics**: Nonbenders like President Raiko and Zhu Li Moon hold significant political positions, with Raiko being elected by a nonbending majority, highlighting the political power of nonbenders. Tonraq, as chief of the Southern Water Tribe, also shows leadership without bending.
- **Cultural Preservation**: The Air Acolytes, a group of nonbenders, play a crucial role in preserving Air Nomad culture, administering temples and maintaining traditions post-genocide.

#### Key Themes Involving Nonbenders
- **Bender vs. Nonbender Conflict**: This is a central theme in LOK, especially in Book 1 with the Equalists, led by Amon (a bloodbender, but his followers are nonbenders). The *Imbalance* comic further explores this tension in Cranefish Town, with characters like Ru and Yaling involved in escalating conflicts.
- **Political Impact**: The Equalists' actions lead to the dissolution of the non-elected City Council, resulting in Raiko's election, showing nonbenders' influence on governance. This is a direct outcome of the bender vs. nonbender tension.
- **Transformation and Potential**: The Harmonic Convergence in LOK allows some nonbenders, like Bumi (Aang's son), to gain airbending, illustrating a rare but significant change in their status. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the Avatar world.

#### Comics and Expanded Canon
The comics, particularly *Imbalance*, provide additional insight into nonbenders' roles. In *Imbalance Part One*, Team Avatar faces disapproval in Cranefish Town due to bender vs. nonbender tensions, setting up a narrative of conflict. *Imbalance Part Two* and *Imbalance Part Three* escalate this to potential war, with nonbenders Ru and Yaling playing pivotal roles, highlighting their agency in the story.
