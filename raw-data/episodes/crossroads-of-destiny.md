### üìñ Synopsis

The season culminates in the crystal catacombs beneath Ba Sing Se where captured characters face their deepest conflicts. Aang and Zuko, imprisoned together, begin to understand each other through shared stories about their mothers and loss. Katara initially refuses to heal Zuko's scar but starts to see his humanity. Meanwhile, Azula and the Dai Li complete their coup, taking control of Ba Sing Se from within. When the final battle erupts, Zuko faces his most crucial choice - joining Aang and Katara or siding with his sister.
