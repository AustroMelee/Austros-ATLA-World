### üìñ Synopsis

After being attacked by Fire Nation soldiers, Team Avatar stumbles upon a town celebrating "Avatar Day" - an anti-Avatar festival. The villagers blame Avatar Kyoshi for killing their leader Chin the Great 370 years ago and arrest Aang for her crimes. Sokka and Katara travel to Kyoshi Island to uncover the truth while Aang faces trial. Meanwhile, Zuko, disguised as the Blue Spirit, steals food for himself and Iroh, but their conflicting philosophies lead to a parting of ways.
