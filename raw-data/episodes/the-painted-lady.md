### üìñ Synopsis

The gang arrives at a Fire Nation village populated by sick and starving people whose river has been polluted by a nearby Fire Nation munitions factory. Against Sokka's objections, Katara assumes the role of "The Painted Lady," a local river spirit, to heal the sick and provide food by stealing from the factory. When her deception is discovered by Aang, he helps her destroy the factory to permanently solve the village's problems. Fire Nation soldiers attack in retaliation, but Team Avatar, still disguised as the Painted Lady, defends the village and drives them off.
