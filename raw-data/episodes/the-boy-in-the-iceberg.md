## EXPANDED VIEW

## Overview

"The Boy in the Iceberg" is the first episode of Book One: Water of Avatar: The Last Airbender and the first of the overall series. It debuted on February 21, 2005.

While fishing, siblings Katara and Sokka discover Aang, a young boy frozen in an iceberg. After freeing him and his flying bison named Appa, they learn his identity as an airbender, long thought extinct, and bring him back to their village in the Southern Water Tribe. After witnessing the beam of light that shot through the sky after the two broke through the ice, Zuko, exiled prince of the Fire Nation tasked with finding the long-lost Avatar to restore his honor, becomes intent on capturing him. While playing, Aang and Katara mistakenly trigger a booby trap in an ancient Fire Nation ship, revealing Aang's whereabouts to the nearby Zuko.

## Introduction

Long ago, the legendary Avatar kept the world and its four nations at peace with each other. However, the Avatar disappeared one hundred years prior and has not been seen since. During that time, the tyrannical Fire Nation used the opportunity to wage war on the other three nations, seeking to conquer them. One hundred years passed, and people began to lose hope that the Avatar would ever return and bring peace back to the world. Even the Southern Water Tribe village of Wolf Cove, located in the distant South Pole sea, has been affected by the Fire Nation's war. The men of the village all sailed abroad to fight, leaving behind the women and children. Sokka and his younger sister Katara are the oldest of the village children in the South Pole.

## Synopsis

### Spear Fishing
While fishing, the siblings Sokka and Katara start to bicker with each other over the latter's waterbending abilities. Two siblings, Katara and Sokka, are out fishing in a small canoe. While Sokka prepares to spear a fish, Katara attempts and succeeds to catch one by bending the water around it, lifting the bubble above the canoe. Sokka, oblivious to his sister's success and ignoring her pleas to look at her catch, readies his spear to strike and accidentally hits the bubble with the back of his weapon, knocking the fish back into the ocean and drenching himself with the water of the now-pierced bubble.

### Discovering the Iceberg
After gathering their bearings, a furious Katara blames her brother for failing to "go left" as she had instructed, though Sokka counters by pointing out that Katara should have waterbent them to safety if she did not like his steering. When he concludes that it could be "[left] to a girl to screw things up". This prompts Katara to lose her temper as she angrily yells at her brother that he is sexist, immature, and "nut-brained". While she continues to rage out about all the things that she does for him as part of her chores, she involuntarily waterbends, cracking a large iceberg and eventually causing it to break and plunge into the ocean.

### Meeting Aang
As they are pushed back on their ice float, another iceberg, basking in blue light and containing two forms, rises to the surface. Deducing one of the forms to be that of a living human, Katara instantly grabs Sokka's club and makes her way over to the iceberg, despite Sokka's order to stay back as they do not know who they are dealing with. As they both arrive at the iceberg, she resolutely starts chopping at it. After several strikes, she is blown back by a gust of air escaping from the hole she managed to make. The two siblings watch in astonishment how the ice breaks from that point and, when the iceberg cracks in two, a bright column of light shoots high into the sky.

### Zuko's Hunt
Prince Zuko, a Fire Nation teenager who has been hunting the Avatar for two years, sees the bright light from his ship. His uncle, Iroh, who has accompanied the young prince on his journey, dismisses the event as completely natural. Zuko orders his crew to head toward the light, insisting that the light was emitted by the Avatar.

### Team Avatar Meeting
After Katara breaks through the ice, she finds the person is a young boy with strange arrow-shaped marks on his head and hands. Sokka, jarred by the bizarre events occurring around him, immediately points his spear at the boy, but the boy simply collapses into Katara's arms. She lays him down and tries to help him. Sokka pokes the boy in the head with the blunt side of his spear, still skeptical, but an annoyed Katara shoos him away.

### Appa's Introduction
Hearing a growling noise from within the crater of the hollowed iceberg, the boy climbs back over the rim to find a large, furry, six-legged creature lying motionless within; it takes a moment for him to enthusiastically rouse it. Sokka asks, unsure, what the thing is and the boy replies that it is Appa, his flying bison. Sokka expresses disbelief over the purported ability of the large bison to fly; Appa sneezes on Sokka, covering him with bison snot.

### Airbending Revelation
The boy, looking around at his surroundings, asks if they live nearby, which angers Sokka to tell Katara not to answer, as he is convinced that the mystery boy is a Fire Nation spy, a notion that Katara rejects sarcastically. Introducing herself, she asks the boy what his name is, though as he tries to answer, he sneezes, launching himself into the air. Drifting deftly back to the ground, he rubs his nose and tells them happily that his name is Aang. Katara, astonished by the distance Aang rose into the air by sneezing, muses that he must be an airbender, which Aang confirms.

### Return to Wolf Cove
Sokka, convinced that he is going crazy, decides aloud to go home and leave behind the nonsensical world he has stumbled upon; he takes all of three steps before realizing, unfortunately, that he is stranded on an iceberg in the middle of the ocean. Aang, seeing the problem, offers to fly the two back to Wolf Cove; Katara happily agrees, while Sokka refuses at first, agreeing after a few seconds only when he realizes he has no other choice.

### Village Introduction
Falling asleep on Appa's back, Aang has a dream, in which he recalls his last moments before being encased in the ice. In it, he and Appa fly through a terrible storm near the South Pole. He remembers the both of them being buffeted by the full fury of the gale, struggling vainly to escape and eventually being forced under the waves. As Aang began to lose consciousness, however, his eyes and tattoos began to glow and he created a bubble around himself and Appa, which he froze solid.

### Airbending Demonstration
Snatching the staff back from Sokka with a quick burst of airbending, Aang tells him that its purpose is not stabbing, but airbending. He promptly opens the wings on the staff, causing Sokka, his terror renewed, to reel back from it as a young girl, thrilled, asks Aang to repeat the "magic trick." Aang gently reminds her that it is airbending, not magic; moving the staff around himself with his arms, he mimics flight as he explains that, by manipulating the currents of air around the glider, he can use it to fly.

### The Hundred Year War
Sokka gives the six young boys of the tribe a stern lecture on their military practices, emphasizing that they are the "warriors" of the tribe, but is interrupted by one of them when he innocently raises his hand and says that he needs to pee. After a brief attempt at getting his point across, Sokka is unhappily asks how many of them need to do the same and all the boys raise their hands. As the kids leave, an annoyed Sokka facepalms and Katara walks up, looking for Aang.

### Penguin Sledding
Some time later, Katara tracks Aang to an icy waste populated by a flock of otter penguins; the airbender is in the process of trying to catch one, but the creatures are proving to be too fast and slippery for him. Katara approaches and agrees to teach him how to catch one, on the condition that Aang teach her waterbending. While he likes the idea, Aang points out reluctantly that he knows nothing about waterbending, being an airbender, and he asks if there are any other waterbenders from whom she could learn.

### Fire Nation Shipwreck
Aang and Katara go penguin sledding afterward; racing through the varied terrain, they eventually enter a tunnel in the ice. Emerging on the other side, they find themselves on a wide, icy plain dominated by an old abandoned shipwreck, which is elevated by a rough outcropping of ice. Aang asks what it is and Katara tells him it is a Fire Navy ship, the source of a dark episode in the tribe's history.

### The Truth About Time
As they explore the ship, Katara explains that the ship is as old as her grandmother and that is was a part of the Fire Nation's first assaults on the tribe. As they investigate a room full of spears, Aang stops her, saying that he has friends all over the world, the Fire Nation included, and that he never saw any war at all. Katara asks him how long he was in the iceberg and Aang, unsure of his own words, guesses that it could have been a few days. Astounded, Katara tells him that it must be around a hundred years.

### Booby Trap
As Aang investigates another room, he accidentally triggers a tripwire. The booby trap imprisons them in the room by obstructing the doorway with metal bars and fires a single flare high into the sky above the ship. Noticing a hole in the ceiling, Aang grabs Katara and, telling her to hold on tight, launches them with airbending through the opening.

### Zuko's Discovery
From the deck of his ship, Prince Zuko, having seen the flare, watches through a spyglass as two small figures jump down the side of the ship. Realizing he has found the last airbender, he comments that the bender is "quite agile for his old age" and yells to a soldier standing behind him to wake his uncle and tell him that he has found the Avatar. Looking through the spyglass again, he tracks the two figures and scouting ahead in the direction they are running toward, his eye lands upon the tiny village in the distance. As he lowers the spyglass, squinting into the distance, Zuko adds quietly that he has also found the Avatar's hiding place.

## Production Notes

### Series Continuity
- In "The Storm", Aang's flashback shows that the iceberg is under the sea. Due to Katara's violent waterbending, however, she unconsciously cracked the ice formation causing it to rise to the surface of the ocean.
- The abandoned Fire Navy ship Aang and Katara explore is the same one Hama and the other waterbenders were shown uprooting decades before in a flashback in the episode "The Puppetmaster".
- The subtitle of the last episode in the series, "Avatar Aang", and this episode's title both refer to Aang himself. They also highlight how he has changed. In the beginning, he is a young Avatar who has not mastered the elements. By the end, he is a fully realized Avatar.

### Character Revelations
- Katara reveals that she is the only waterbender in the South Pole.
- During Aang's dream, it is revealed how he came to be frozen in the iceberg.

### Trivia
- This is the only episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender to feature a different and extended opening sequence on both the television and DVD versions worldwide. The second episode features it only in the German television cut.
- Though this is the first official episode of the series, the unaired pilot was created beforehand, but never aired on television.
- Sokka said he might have "Midnight Sun Madness." This is referring to a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the Sun remains visible at the local midnight.
- This is one of only two episodes that shows "To be continued" before the ending credits. The other is "The Boiling Rock, Part 1".
- The creators of the show like to think that Aang and Appa were "floating in a ball of energy" instead of being frozen solid.
- This episode and "The Avatar Returns" are the only episodes of Book One: Water not to have aired on a Friday.
- The initial title of this episode was "The Boy with Tattoos".
- A scene from this episode was ranked #24 in the "100 Greatest Moments in Nicktoon History" ranking.
- The description for the episode on Netflix originally referred to both Sokka and Katara as waterbenders, but this error was later corrected.

## Key Themes

### Discovery and Awakening
The episode centers around the discovery of Aang, the last airbender, and his awakening from a century-long slumber. This discovery sets in motion the entire series' plot and introduces the concept of the Avatar's return.

### War and Peace
The episode establishes the backdrop of the Hundred Year War and the Fire Nation's conquest of the other nations. It shows how the war has affected even remote villages like Wolf Cove.

### Bending Arts
The episode introduces three of the four bending arts: waterbending (Katara), airbending (Aang), and firebending (Zuko). Each bending style is shown with its unique characteristics and limitations.

### Friendship and Trust
The episode explores the beginning of the friendship between Aang, Katara, and Sokka, as well as the challenges of trust and acceptance in a world at war.

## Cultural Impact

"The Boy in the Iceberg" established the foundation for one of the most beloved animated series of all time. It introduced audiences to the rich world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, its complex characters, and the unique bending system that would become central to the show's mythology.

The episode's success led to the creation of a franchise that includes three seasons of television, comics, novels, and a live-action adaptation, cementing its place in animation history.
