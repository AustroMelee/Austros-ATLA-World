### üìñ Synopsis

Toph begins teaching Aang earthbending, but he struggles to grasp the concept due to his airbending nature being opposite to earthbending's direct, confrontational approach. Meanwhile, Iroh attempts to teach Zuko an advanced firebending technique - lightning redirection - which requires inner peace and emotional balance that Zuko lacks. Both teachers and students become frustrated with the slow progress. When Katara and Sokka become trapped in a crevice, Aang must overcome his earthbending difficulties to save them, finally achieving his first successful earthbending through desperation and determination. The episode explores the fundamental differences between bending disciplines and the emotional requirements for mastery.
