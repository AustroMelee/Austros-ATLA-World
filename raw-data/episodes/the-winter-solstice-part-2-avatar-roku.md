Aang and his friends infiltrate a Fire Nation temple so Aang can speak with Avatar Roku during the Winter Solstice. They must reach the temple's sanctuary before sunset while avoiding the temple's guardian, Shyu, and the Fire Sages who serve the Fire Nation. Aang successfully communicates with Avatar Roku, who warns him that he must master all four elements and defeat Fire Lord Ozai before Sozin's Comet returns in one year, or the Fire Nation will use its power to end the war permanently. Meanwhile, Zuko and Iroh escape from their Earth Kingdom captors with unexpected help from Iroh's tea-brewing skills and lightning redirection technique.
