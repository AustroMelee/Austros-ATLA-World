Aang and the crew arrive at Omashu to find the city captured by the Fire Nation. Disguising themselves with fake pentapox to enter the city, they discover a resistance movement led by earthbenders who are planning to evacuate all the citizens. When the Governor's infant son Tom-Tom accidentally gets mixed up in the evacuation, Aang attempts to trade him for King Bumi, but the plan fails when Azula calls off the exchange.
