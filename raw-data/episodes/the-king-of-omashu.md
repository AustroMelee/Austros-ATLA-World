### 📖 Synopsis

Aang, Katara, and Sokka arrive at Omashu, where Aang reminisces about his childhood friend Bumi. Disguised, they enter the city and ride the mail delivery system, but are arrested for causing chaos. The old king recognizes Aang as the Avatar and subjects him to three deadly challenges. Aang retrieves a key from a waterfall, finds the king's pet Flopsie, and chooses to duel the king himself. After passing all tests, Aang realizes the king is Bumi, who urges him to "open his brain to the possibilities." Bumi reveals the importance of thinking differently and encourages Aang to master all elements to defeat Fire Lord Ozai.
