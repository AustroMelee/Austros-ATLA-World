### üìñ Synopsis

Following a lead about a potential earthbending teacher, Team Avatar arrives in Gaoling where they attend an underground earthbending wrestling tournament called Earth Rumble VI. There, Aang recognizes the reigning champion, "The Blind Bandit," as the girl from his vision in the swamp. The Blind Bandit turns out to be Toph Bei Fong, a 12-year-old earthbending prodigy who is blind but uses seismic sense to "see" through vibrations. Despite her incredible abilities, Toph is sheltered by her overprotective wealthy parents who treat her as helpless.
