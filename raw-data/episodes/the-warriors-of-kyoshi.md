### üìñ Synopsis

Aang brings Katara and Sokka to Kyoshi Island to ride the giant koi fish, but after a close encounter with the unagi, the team is captured by a group of female warriors. Aang reveals he is a reincarnation of Kyoshi Island's founder, Avatar Kyoshi, though the villagers do not believe him and plan to throw the three friends to the unagi. After Aang frees himself and demonstrates his airbending, the villagers celebrate the arrival of the Avatar. Word of his presence eventually reaches Zuko, who sets sail to Kyoshi Island immediately. Sokka befriends the Kyoshi Warrior leader, Suki, who teaches him the warrior skills of Kyoshi. She manages to change his sexist attitude in the process while also developing a crush on him. However, Zuko arrives and attacks the village, forcing Team Avatar to leave the village and draw Zuko away. As they depart, Aang manages to ride and control the unagi, using the creature's water spray to douse the flames raging through the village, saving it from total ruin.
