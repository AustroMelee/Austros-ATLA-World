#### 📝 Synopsis
Before the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Team Avatar takes refuge on Ember Island where they discover a Fire Nation theater troupe performing a play about their adventures called "The Boy in the Iceberg." The wildly inaccurate and over-dramatic production frustrates the group with its misrepresentations: Aang is portrayed by a woman, Toph by a large man, and their relationships are completely wrong. As they watch their journey unfold on stage, the characters reflect on how far they've come and what lies ahead. The play's tragic ending, where the Fire Nation wins and Ozai kills Aang, serves as a stark reminder of what could happen if they fail in their upcoming mission.
