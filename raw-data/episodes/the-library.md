### üìñ Synopsis

Following a tip from a professor, Team Avatar seeks Wan Shi Tong's library, a legendary repository of knowledge buried in the Si Wong Desert. Despite the owl spirit's initial hostility toward humans, they gain access by promising to use knowledge for good, not military purposes. While exploring the vast library and its fox spirit assistants, they discover crucial information about a solar eclipse that could disable firebending.
