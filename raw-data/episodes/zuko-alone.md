### üìñ Synopsis

Traveling alone after separating from Iroh, Zuko arrives in a poor Earth Kingdom town controlled by Earth Kingdom soldiers who abuse their power. He reluctantly helps a local family‚Äîparticularly befriending young Lee‚Äîwhile trying to maintain his anonymity. Through flashbacks, we see Zuko's childhood at the Fire Nation palace, including his relationship with his cousin Lu Ten, his mother Ursa's disappearance, and his father's manipulation. When Earth Kingdom soldiers threaten Lee's family, Zuko is forced to reveal his firebending to protect them, leading the townspeople to reject him despite his heroism. The episode ends with Zuko once again alone, having learned that good intentions don't erase past actions.
