Aang excitedly leads Katara and Sokka to the Southern Air Temple, his former home, eager to reunite with his people. However, upon arrival, he discovers the devastating truth - the Fire Nation has eradicated all the airbenders, including his beloved mentor Monk Gyatso. The discovery of Gyatso's skeleton and the remains of Fire Nation soldiers triggers Aang's first Avatar State, which alerts temples worldwide to the Avatar's return.
