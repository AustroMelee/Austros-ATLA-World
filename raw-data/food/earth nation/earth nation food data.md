Earth Kingdom
Earth Kingdom cuisine
The Earth Kingdom offers a variety of dishes, some of which were served to Zuko and Iroh when they visited Song's home.

People in the Earth Kingdom grow and eat a wide variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and rice; meat, such as beef and poultry, from wild game and farms is also common.[2][72] There are many regional variations in the types of food eaten, ranging from simpler village fare to the elaborate roasts, cakes, and other delicacies found in Ba Sing Se. While having a meal in Ba Sing Se, Zuko commented that the food tasted almost identical to Fire Nation food but less seasoned.[73]

Cooking style
Due to its size, the Earth Kingdom has many variations in climate which in turn affect food preparation, resulting in a variety of cooking methods being utilized in the nation. While in Gaoling and the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se, the cuisine is characterstic for its sweet and sour flavor, the food in the west is significantly more sour, rich in spices, and sometimes spicy. In the forested areas, dishes are usually spit-roasted or smoldered underground in clay or dirt. The islands of the Earth Kingdom, however, use more seafood and have more influences from the Fire Nation due to their proximity and the blend of cuisines in the colonies.[74] Boiling is used for rice and many vegetables, while fish is usually steamed and meats are generally roasted. Baking is used extensively to make cakes, buns, and tarts. In the metal city of Zaofu, they serve a fusion cuisine of gourmet and vegetarian entrées, most of which use specially prepared ingredients such as kale.
