Water Tribe
Sea prunes
Stewed sea prunes are a Southern Water Tribe delicacy.

Because of the barren land on which they live, the people of the Water Tribe draw most of their food sources from the ocean, save some ground harvests during the warmer seasons. Nothing was wasted as they made the most from every animal that was caught in the poles, knowing they always needed to conserve and think about the future,[38] and so everything was also carefully divvied up and kept on ice to be used or eaten for months afterward.[39] Staples of the cuisine include crab, sea prunes, squid, seal jerky, and many variations of seaweed.[2][39] Meat generally plays an important role in many Water Tribe dishes.[40][41]

Although the cuisine of the Northern and Southern Water Tribes are similar, there are certain differences.[40] During the Hundred Year War, people from the Water Tribes were restricted to food found in their homes, however, after its end, people were able to safely spread out beyond the poles and get ingredients that were once rare imported luxuries.[39] By Avatar Korra's lifetime, both tribes had reestablished themselves on the international stage, and food began to diversify as imports from other nations were incorporated into local cuisines.[42] Due to this development, Katara used to view the Water Tribe food as a convergence of preservation and exploration.[39]

Cooking style
The main cooking styles of the Water Tribe are boiling and stewing, as they lack the resources to make more elaborate dishes. Additionally, as they live in a colder part of the world, it is more practical to have foods like stews that warm the body and less practical to have things like salads. Many foods are also dried and preserved, such as jerky made out of seal meat. When the people from the Water Tribes cook, they channel the beat of the water into their food, moistening it, swirling water to poach, and bubbling broth to extract its residue.[39]
