United Republic of Nations
Republic City cuisine
Consumers in Republic City are able to enjoy a variety of foods from around the world.

The often fast-paced sense of life in the United Republic of Nations has given rise to commercially prepared foods, such as instant noodles and snack cakes. Many citizens find it convenient to eat meals in a hurry, and have meals from workplace cafeterias, or from street food carts.[208][209] The rise of large corporations in the nation has even led to there being restaurant chains under shared franchising agreements, which compete with the traditional small, independent eateries.[210]

Most of the United Republic's gourmet cuisine are adaptations of dishes from the other nations. The cosmopolitan sense of life in the nation has led to a variety of world fusion dishes, such as traditional Earth Kingdom dishes being adjusted with Fire Nation spices.[211]
