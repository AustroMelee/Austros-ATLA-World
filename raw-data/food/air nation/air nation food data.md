Air Nomads
Air Nation cuisine
Air Nomad cuisine consists of strictly vegetarian meals.

Much of the culinary traditions of the Air Nomads were lost after their civilization was nearly wiped out at the beginning of the Hundred Year War. However, it is known that the most defining characteristic of their cuisine was strict vegetarianism,[1] and they were also known for their sweets, such as fruit pies and custard tarts,[2] as many monks were skilled bakers.[3] In keeping with their traditional philosophy of non-violence and not harming the environment, the Air Nomads cultivated their own food in ways that caused the minimal environmental impact.[4] Following the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang attempted to reconstruct some of the Air Nomad cuisine from memory as well as based on scrolls he found in the air temples. However, as the documents were often badly damaged and nearly illegible, and he had been no professional cook, he was forced to improvise.[5] Regardless, he hoped that his work would help to keep some elements of Air Nomad culture alive and to carry on the philosophies of their cooking. While many of the particular vegetables and fruits that once grew in abundance among each temple's peaks were gone, the Avatar attempted to recreate certain items with available substitutes in the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation. For this task, Aang requested Toph Beifong's aid to revitalize the nomads' stone ovens.[6]

Cooking style
The Air Nomads' cuisine was not just about sustenance, but also about having fun with their airbending ingredients and with each other. The monks would usually prepare treats with expert airbending and teach that a tasty meal cannot be constructed with ingredients that have not been properly loved and taken care of, as cooking starts from the seed and all the way until the food ends up on the plate.[6] The Air Nomads were known to be skilled at baking[7] and steaming.[8] They are also known to not use much salt or spices in their food.[9][10] While they primarily used ingredients found at the temples, they also experimented with flavors and ingredients from across the nations, such as their sweet rice, which they could adapt to any fruits and nuts in order to prepare during their travels.[11]
