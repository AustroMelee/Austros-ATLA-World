### 📖 Overview

The Elbow Leech is a massive parasitic worm native to the Foggy Swamp of the Earth Kingdom. This enormous invertebrate is known for its unusual feeding behavior, specifically targeting the elbow joints of its hosts. The creature's size and parasitic nature make it one of the most feared inhabitants of the swamp.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Elbow Leeches are found exclusively in the Foggy Swamp and surrounding wetland areas of the Earth Kingdom. They prefer dark, humid environments with plenty of water and vegetation where they can hide and ambush potential hosts. These worms are particularly common in areas with high animal traffic.

### 🎭 Cultural Significance

In Earth Kingdom culture, Elbow Leeches are universally feared and are often mentioned in swamp survival guides and local horror stories. They serve as warnings about the dangers of venturing into the Foggy Swamp unprepared. Their unique feeding behavior has made them subjects of fascination and revulsion in local folklore.

### 🦅 Behavior & Abilities

Elbow Leeches are parasitic creatures that attach themselves to the elbow joints of larger animals, including humans. They are excellent swimmers and can move through water and mud with surprising speed. These worms are known for their patience, often waiting motionless for hours until a suitable host passes by.

### 🍖 Diet & Hunting

These worms are blood-feeding parasites that attach themselves to the elbow joints of their hosts and feed on blood and tissue fluids. They use specialized mouthparts to create a secure attachment and secrete anticoagulants to keep the blood flowing. Elbow Leeches can feed for extended periods, growing larger as they consume more blood.

### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics

Elbow Leeches are enormous worms, typically reaching lengths of 3-6 feet and diameters of 4-8 inches when fully engorged. They have dark, segmented bodies with smooth, slimy skin that helps them move through water and mud. Their most distinctive features are their specialized mouthparts and powerful suckers for attachment.

### ⏰ Lifespan & Reproduction

These worms typically live 5-10 years in the wild. They are hermaphroditic and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. After feeding, they detach from their hosts and lay hundreds of eggs in protected areas. Young leeches are independent from birth and must find their own hosts.

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Elbow Leeches are considered a species of least concern, with stable populations in their swamp habitats. However, their parasitic nature and threat to humans have led to some population control efforts in areas near settlements. Conservation focuses on maintaining swamp ecosystems while managing human-leech conflicts.

### 🔗 Relations & Interactions

- **Prey**: Blood and tissue fluids from host animals
- **Predators**: Large swamp predators, humans (when removed)
- **Competitors**: Other parasitic organisms
- **Symbiotic**: Help control populations of larger animals through parasitism

### 🌟 Notable Examples

While no specific Elbow Leeches are mentioned in historical records, they are frequently referenced in swamp survival guides and local horror stories throughout Earth Kingdom history.
