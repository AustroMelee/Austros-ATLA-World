### 📖 Overview

The Eel Hound is a remarkable amphibious creature native to the Earth Kingdom, known for its ability to travel swiftly over both land and water. This unique hybrid combines the characteristics of eels and hounds, creating a versatile transportation animal that has been domesticated by humans for centuries.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Eel Hounds are found throughout the Earth Kingdom, particularly in coastal regions, river valleys, and areas with abundant water sources. They prefer environments where they can easily access both land and water, making them common in fishing villages, port cities, and areas with extensive waterway networks.

### 🎭 Cultural Significance

In Earth Kingdom culture, Eel Hounds are highly valued as transportation animals, particularly for their ability to navigate both terrestrial and aquatic environments. They are often used by fishermen, traders, and travelers who need to cross bodies of water quickly. These creatures are considered symbols of adaptability and the Earth Kingdom's connection to both land and sea.

### 🦅 Behavior & Abilities

Eel Hounds are highly intelligent and trainable animals that form strong bonds with their human handlers. They are excellent swimmers and runners, capable of sustained travel over long distances. These creatures are known for their loyalty and protective instincts, often serving as both transportation and guardians for their owners.

### 🍖 Diet & Hunting

These animals are carnivorous, feeding on fish, small aquatic animals, and occasionally small land animals. They are skilled hunters both in water and on land, using their speed and agility to catch prey. Eel Hounds are also known to scavenge when food is scarce, making them adaptable to various environmental conditions.

### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics

Eel Hounds are medium to large animals, typically measuring 4-6 feet in length and standing 2-3 feet tall at the shoulder. They have streamlined bodies with smooth, eel-like skin that helps them move efficiently through water. Their legs are strong and webbed, allowing them to run on land and swim effectively.

### ⏰ Lifespan & Reproduction

These animals typically live 12-18 years in captivity and slightly less in the wild. They form monogamous pairs and breed seasonally, with females giving birth to 2-4 pups per litter. Young Eel Hounds are cared for by both parents and learn to swim and hunt from an early age.

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Eel Hounds are considered a species of least concern, with stable populations throughout their range. Their domestication and usefulness to humans have helped maintain their populations, though wild populations are protected in certain areas. Conservation efforts focus on maintaining genetic diversity and protecting wild habitats.

### 🔗 Relations & Interactions

- **Prey**: Fish, small aquatic animals, small land animals, carrion
- **Predators**: Large aquatic predators, humans (rarely)
- **Competitors**: Other aquatic predators, land predators
- **Symbiotic**: Domesticated by humans for transportation and companionship

### 🌟 Notable Examples

While no specific Eel Hounds are mentioned in historical records, they are commonly used throughout the Earth Kingdom for transportation and are frequently referenced in travel guides and fishing traditions.
