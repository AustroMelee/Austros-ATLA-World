### 📖 Overview

The Boar-Q-Pine is a formidable wild boar native to the Earth Kingdom's dense forests and mountainous regions. This large mammal is distinguished by its coat of sharp, detachable quills that serve as both protection and a weapon. These quills can be launched at predators or threats, making the Boar-Q-Pine one of the most dangerous wild animals in the Earth Kingdom.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Boar-Q-Pines are found throughout the Earth Kingdom's forested regions, particularly in dense woodlands, mountainous areas, and thick underbrush. They prefer areas with plenty of cover and access to water sources, often establishing territories in remote, difficult-to-reach locations.

### 🎭 Notable Examples

- **Thornback**: A particularly large and aggressive individual known for its unusually long quills
- **Forest Guardian**: A legendary Boar-Q-Pine that protects ancient groves near Omashu
- **Mountain King**: A massive specimen that rules the highland territories

### 🏛️ Cultural Significance

In Earth Kingdom folklore, the Boar-Q-Pine represents both danger and protection. Their quills are sometimes collected and used in traditional medicine and crafts. Hunters respect these creatures for their ferocity and defensive capabilities, often avoiding them unless absolutely necessary.

### 🐗 Behavior & Characteristics

Boar-Q-Pines are primarily solitary creatures, though they may form small family groups during breeding season. They are most active during dawn and dusk, using their keen sense of smell to locate food. When threatened, they can launch their quills with surprising accuracy and force.

### ⚡ Abilities

- **Quill Projection**: Can launch sharp quills at threats
- **Enhanced Senses**: Excellent hearing and smell for detecting danger
- **Territorial Defense**: Fiercely protect their territory
- **Adaptive Survival**: Can thrive in various forest environments

### 🍖 Diet

Boar-Q-Pines are omnivorous, feeding on roots, tubers, nuts, small animals, and carrion. They use their strong snouts to root through the forest floor in search of food.

### 📏 Size & Lifespan

- **Size**: Large, comparable to a full-grown wild boar
- **Weight**: 200-400 pounds
- **Lifespan**: 10-15 years in the wild

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Boar-Q-Pines are common throughout their range but are respected and often avoided by travelers. Their populations are stable, though they are less common near heavily populated areas due to their aggressive nature.
