### 📖 Overview

The Fox Antelope is a graceful hybrid creature native to the Earth Kingdom's grasslands and plains. This medium-sized mammal combines the speed and agility of a fox with the strength and horns of an antelope, making it a swift and elegant herbivore that roams the vast open spaces of the Earth Kingdom.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Fox Antelopes are found throughout the Earth Kingdom's grasslands, plains, and open woodlands. They prefer areas with plenty of open space for running and access to water sources. They are particularly common in the central and southern regions of the Earth Kingdom, where grasslands are abundant.

### 🎭 Notable Examples

- **Plains Dancer**: A graceful specimen known for its elegant movements

### 🏛️ Cultural Significance

In Earth Kingdom culture, the Fox Antelope represents grace, speed, and the beauty of the natural world. Their elegant movements and swift running have made them symbols of freedom and the untamed spirit of the plains. They are often featured in Earth Kingdom art and poetry.

### 🦊 Behavior & Characteristics

Fox Antelopes are social creatures that live in herds, though they may also be found in smaller family groups. They are most active during dawn and dusk, using their speed and agility to escape predators. They are generally peaceful unless threatened, when they can use their horns for defense.

- **Horn Defense**: Can use their horns to defend against threats

- **Weight**: 100-200 pounds
- **Lifespan**: 12-15 years in the wild

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Fox Antelopes are common throughout their range and are well-adapted to their environment. Their populations are stable, and they are generally left alone by humans due to their peaceful nature and lack of threat to agriculture.
