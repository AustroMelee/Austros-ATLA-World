More about the World of Avatar
A vast range of fauna inhabit the world, ranging over virtually every landscape as well as the oceans and skies. Most of the animals presented are hybrids of two real world animals; sometimes this hybridization is explicit, at other times more subtle. There are certain exceptions though, such as Kuei's pet bear, Bosco, the herbalist's cat, Miyuki, or the dragon hawk.

Habitats
There are several distinct habitats in the Avatar World, suitable for different animals and plants.

Foggy Swamp
Due to the wet climate and abundant vegetation, the Foggy Swamp plays host to a large variety of fauna. Hundreds of living things are densely packed into the swamp; this includes swamp fireflies, elbow leeches, screeching dodos, and catgators.[1]

Great Divide
The Great Divide has various species due to an arid climate. This unique area is home to certain creatures, such as the canyon crawlers.[2]

Poles
The low temperatures in both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes do not allow for much fauna to thrive. However, there are some animals that have adapted to the cold environment, such as otter penguins, tiger seals, polar dogs, polar bear dogs, and buffalo yaks.

Si Wong Desert
The Si Wong Desert has the driest, hottest climate in the world. The desert's ecosystem primarily consists of a few scavenger species such as the gilacorn, predatory insects known as buzzard wasps, giant rhinoceros beetles, which are used for transportation, scorpions, and jackalopes.[3]
