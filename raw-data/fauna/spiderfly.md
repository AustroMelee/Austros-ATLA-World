### 📖 Overview

The Spiderfly is a hybrid creature combining the characteristics of a spider and a fly. These unusual insects are known for their ability to spin webs like spiders while also possessing the flight capabilities of flies. Ironically, spiderflies can sometimes get caught in their own webs, creating a unique and somewhat comical situation.

### ✨ Notable Examples

- **Temple Spiderflies:** Various spiderflies that inhabit the Air Temples, particularly in areas where they can build their webs undisturbed.

### 🌍 Habitat & Distribution

Spiderflies are commonly found in the Air Temples and surrounding areas where they can find suitable locations to build their webs. They prefer areas with good airflow and access to flying insects for prey.

### 🔗 Cultural Significance

Spiderflies represent the sometimes contradictory nature of hybrid creatures in the Avatar world. Their ability to both create webs and fly, yet sometimes get caught in their own creations, serves as a reminder of the complexity and unpredictability of nature.

### 🎭 Behavior & Characteristics

Spiderflies combine the web-spinning abilities of spiders with the flight capabilities of flies. They are predatory insects that catch other flying insects in their webs. Despite their flying ability, they can sometimes become entangled in their own webs, creating a unique behavioral quirk.
