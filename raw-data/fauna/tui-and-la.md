### 📖 Overview

Tui and La are the physical manifestations of the Moon and Ocean spirits, appearing as koi fish that swim in an eternal dance within the Northern Water Tribe's Spirit Oasis. These sacred beings represent the balance of push and pull, the fundamental forces that govern the world's oceans and the moon's influence on waterbending.

### 🏔️ Habitat & Distribution

Tui and La reside exclusively in the Spirit Oasis of the Northern Water Tribe, a sacred location where the physical and spirit worlds meet. This oasis is protected by the Northern Water Tribe and serves as a bridge between the human world and the spirit realm, making it one of the most spiritually significant locations in the world.

### 🎭 Cultural Significance

In Water Tribe culture, Tui and La represent the very essence of waterbending and the balance of natural forces. They are revered as the original waterbenders who taught humans the art of waterbending. The Northern Water Tribe considers them sacred protectors, and their presence in the Spirit Oasis is central to the tribe's spiritual identity.

### 🐾 Behavior & Abilities

Tui and La are known for their eternal dance, which represents the push and pull of the ocean's tides and the moon's influence on water. They are highly intelligent spirits that can communicate with humans who are spiritually attuned. Their dance maintains the balance of the world's waters and influences waterbending abilities.

### 🍖 Diet & Hunting

As spiritual beings, Tui and La do not require physical sustenance in the traditional sense. They draw their energy from the spiritual connection between the moon and ocean, maintaining their existence through the eternal dance that represents the fundamental forces of nature.

### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics

Tui and La appear as large, majestic koi fish with distinctive markings that represent their spiritual nature. Their size and appearance are symbolic rather than physical, as they are manifestations of cosmic forces rather than ordinary creatures.

### ⏰ Lifespan & Reproduction

As spiritual beings, Tui and La are eternal and do not age or reproduce in the traditional sense. They have existed since the beginning of time and will continue to exist as long as the balance between moon and ocean is maintained.

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Tui and La are protected by the Northern Water Tribe and are considered sacred beings that must be preserved at all costs. Their well-being is directly tied to the health of the world's oceans and the spiritual balance of the world. Any threat to them represents a threat to the fundamental forces of nature.
