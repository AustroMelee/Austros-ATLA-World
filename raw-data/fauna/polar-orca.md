### 🌍 Habitat & Distribution

Polar orcas are found in the frigid waters around both the North and South Poles, where they thrive in the cold aquatic environments. They are commonly seen in areas with ice floes and in the deeper waters of the polar regions where their prey congregates.

### 🔗 Cultural Significance

Polar orcas represent the power and majesty of the arctic marine environment. They are respected by the Water Tribes as powerful predators and are often seen as symbols of the strength and resilience required to survive in such harsh conditions. Their presence in polar waters is a reminder of the wild, untamed nature of the arctic seas.
