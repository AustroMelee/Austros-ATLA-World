Their unique appearance and behavior have made them subjects of both fascination and caution among travelers.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Canyon Crawlers are found exclusively in the Great Divide region of the Earth Kingdom, where they inhabit the deep canyons, rocky outcrops, and arid landscapes. They prefer areas with plenty of hiding spots and access to food sources, often establishing territories in the most inhospitable parts of the canyon system.

Their ability to thrive in the inhospitable Great Divide has made them symbols of resilience and the tenacity of life. Travelers often tell stories of encounters with these creatures as they navigate the dangerous canyon system.

### 🕷️ Behavior & Characteristics

Canyon Crawlers are primarily solitary creatures, though they may gather in small groups when food is abundant. They are most active during the night, using their six eyes to navigate the dark canyon environment. They are generally non-aggressive unless threatened, preferring to avoid confrontation.
