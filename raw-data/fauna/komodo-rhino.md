The Komodo Rhino is a formidable reptilian creature native to the Fire Nation, known for its ferocity and versatility as a cavalry mount. These creatures are particularly associated with elite military units like the Rough Rhinos, where their strength and endurance make them ideal for combat situations.

### 🏔️ Habitat & Distribution

Komodo Rhinos are found throughout the Fire Nation's volcanic regions, particularly in areas with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. They thrive in the harsh, arid conditions that characterize much of the Fire Nation's landscape, making them well-suited for military operations in challenging environments.

### 🎭 Cultural Significance

In Fire Nation military culture, the Komodo Rhino represents strength, loyalty, and the indomitable spirit of the nation's armed forces. The Rough Rhinos, one of the most feared cavalry units, have made these creatures synonymous with elite military prowess and Fire Nation dominance.

### 🐾 Behavior & Abilities

Their thick, scaly hide provides natural armor against attacks, while their powerful legs allow them to charge through enemy lines with devastating force.

### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics
