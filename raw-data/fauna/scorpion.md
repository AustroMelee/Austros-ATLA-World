### 📖 Overview

The Scorpion is a venomous arachnid native to the Earth Kingdom's desert regions, particularly the Si Wong Desert. This dangerous creature is perfectly adapted to the harsh desert environment, where it hunts for prey and defends itself with its powerful venom. Their distinctive appearance and deadly sting have made them both feared and respected throughout the Earth Kingdom.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Scorpions are found throughout the Earth Kingdom's desert regions, particularly in the Si Wong Desert and other arid areas. They prefer areas with plenty of hiding spots, such as under rocks, in crevices, and in burrows they dig in the sand. They are most active during the night when the desert is cooler.

### 🎭 Notable Examples

Travelers often tell stories of encounters with these creatures as warnings about the perils of desert travel.

### 🦂 Behavior & Characteristics

Scorpions are primarily solitary creatures that hunt at night, using their keen senses to detect prey. They are generally non-aggressive unless threatened, preferring to avoid confrontation. When threatened, they can deliver a powerful sting that can be deadly to smaller animals and dangerous to humans.
