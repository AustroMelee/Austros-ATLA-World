### 📖 Overview

The Sea Vulture is a coastal scavenger bird native to the Earth Kingdom's western coastline. This large raptor has adapted to life along the shores, feeding primarily on carrion and marine debris. Their presence along the coastlines makes them a common sight for fishermen and coastal communities.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Sea Vultures are found along the western coast of the Earth Kingdom, particularly in areas with active fishing communities and abundant marine life. They prefer coastal cliffs, rocky outcrops, and areas where they can easily spot carrion or fishing activity. These birds are commonly seen around fishing villages and ports.

### 🎭 Cultural Significance

In Earth Kingdom coastal culture, Sea Vultures are often seen as both helpful and ominous. They help keep coastal areas clean by consuming carrion, but their presence is also associated with death and the sea's dangers. Fishermen sometimes consider them good omens when they appear, as they may indicate nearby fish or warn of approaching storms.

### 🦅 Behavior & Abilities

Sea Vultures are excellent soarers, using thermal currents to glide for hours over coastal areas in search of food. They have keen eyesight and can spot carrion from great distances. These birds are highly social, often gathering in groups around food sources, though they may become aggressive when competing for resources.

### 🍖 Diet & Foraging

These birds are primarily scavengers, feeding on dead fish, marine mammals, and other carrion washed ashore. They also consume eggs and chicks from coastal bird colonies and may occasionally hunt small, sick, or injured animals. Sea Vultures play an important role in coastal ecosystems by cleaning up dead animals.

### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics

Sea Vultures are large birds, with wingspans reaching 6-8 feet and body lengths of 2-3 feet. They have dark plumage, typically brown or black, which helps them blend into coastal rocks and cliffs. Their heads are often bare or lightly feathered, an adaptation for feeding on carrion. They have strong, hooked beaks for tearing flesh.

### ⏰ Lifespan & Reproduction

These birds typically live 20-30 years in the wild. They form monogamous pairs and build large nests on coastal cliffs or in tall trees near the shore. Females lay 1-2 eggs per clutch, and both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Young birds fledge after about 3-4 months.

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Sea Vultures are considered a species of least concern, with stable populations along the Earth Kingdom's coastlines. However, pollution and overfishing can impact their food sources, leading to localized population declines. Conservation efforts focus on protecting coastal habitats and maintaining healthy marine ecosystems.

### 🔗 Relations & Interactions

- **Prey**: Carrion, dead fish, marine mammals, eggs, small animals
- **Predators**: Larger birds of prey, humans (occasionally)
- **Competitors**: Other scavenger birds, coastal predators
- **Symbiotic**: Help clean coastal areas and control disease spread

### 🌟 Notable Examples

While no specific Sea Vultures are mentioned in historical records, they are a common sight along Earth Kingdom coastlines and are frequently referenced in coastal folklore and fishing traditions.
