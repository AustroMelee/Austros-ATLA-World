### 📖 Overview

The Iguana Parrot is a unique avian species native to the Earth Kingdom, distinguished by its reptilian features and vibrant green plumage. This hybrid creature combines the characteristics of both iguanas and parrots, creating a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation in the Avatar world.

### 🏞️ Habitat & Distribution

Iguana Parrots are primarily found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Earth Kingdom, particularly in the southern territories and coastal areas. They thrive in dense forests, mangroves, and areas with abundant vegetation, where they can find both food and shelter. These birds are commonly spotted in the Foggy Swamp and other humid environments.

### 🎭 Cultural Significance

In Earth Kingdom culture, Iguana Parrots are often seen as symbols of adaptability and resilience, representing the kingdom's ability to thrive in diverse environments. Their unique appearance has made them popular subjects in local art and folklore, and they are sometimes kept as exotic pets by wealthy collectors.

### 🦅 Behavior & Abilities

Iguana Parrots are highly intelligent and social birds, often forming small flocks in the wild. They are excellent climbers, using their large talons to grip branches and tree trunks. These birds are known for their vocal abilities, capable of mimicking sounds and developing complex communication patterns within their groups.

### 🍖 Diet & Foraging

These birds have an omnivorous diet, feeding on fruits, nuts, seeds, and occasionally small insects or other invertebrates. They use their strong beaks to crack open nuts and their talons to grasp food items. Iguana Parrots are also known to forage on the ground, using their reptilian features to navigate through underbrush.

### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics

Iguana Parrots are medium-sized birds, typically measuring 12-18 inches in length with wingspans of 20-30 inches. Their most distinctive feature is their green, scaly skin that resembles iguana hide, combined with traditional bird feathers. They have large, powerful talons and a strong, curved beak adapted for their varied diet.

### ⏰ Lifespan & Reproduction

These birds typically live 15-25 years in the wild. They form monogamous pairs during breeding season and build nests in tree cavities or dense vegetation. Females lay 2-4 eggs per clutch, and both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Young birds fledge after about 6-8 weeks.

### 🛡️ Conservation Status

Iguana Parrots are considered a species of least concern, with stable populations throughout their range. However, habitat destruction and capture for the pet trade have led to some population declines in certain areas. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their forest habitats and regulating trade.

### 🔗 Relations & Interactions

- **Prey**: Fruits, nuts, seeds, small invertebrates
- **Predators**: Larger birds of prey, arboreal predators
- **Competitors**: Other frugivorous birds
- **Symbiotic**: Help disperse seeds through their feeding habits

### 🌟 Notable Examples

While no specific Iguana Parrots are mentioned in historical records, they are a common sight in Earth Kingdom forests and are frequently referenced in local folklore and nature guides.
