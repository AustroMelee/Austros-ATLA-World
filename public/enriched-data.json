    "expandedView": "- Name: Azulon\r\n- Nation: Fire Nation\r\n- Age: 95 (at time of death)\r\n- Overview: As the son of Fire Lord Sozin, Azulon inherited the Hundred Year War and prosecuted it with brutal efficiency for 75 years. A famed general and prodigy, he nearly annihilated the Southern Water Tribe and secured many victories against the Earth Kingdom. His reign was defined by military conquest and a cold, demanding demeanor, favoring his firstborn son Iroh and showing little affection for Ozai, which ultimately led to his own assassination at the hands of his ambitious second son.\r\n\r\n- Narrative Highlights:\r\n  - Ruled as Fire Lord for 75 years, overseeing most of the Hundred Year War.\r\n  - Ordered the raids that nearly wiped out the Southern Water Tribe.\r\n  - Commanded his son Ozai to kill Zuko as punishment for disrespect.\r\n  - Was poisoned by Ozai in a conspiracy with Ursa to seize the throne.\r\n\r\n- Role in the Story: A posthumous antagonist whose actions shaped the world of the series and whose death set the final, most brutal stage of the war in motion.\r\n\r\n- Relationships:\r\n  - Iroh (Firstborn Son, Favored Heir)\r\n  - Ozai (Second Son, Usurper, Killer)\r\n  - Ursa (Daughter-in-Law)\r\n  - Zuko & Azula (Grandchildren)\r\n  - Sozin (Father, Predecessor)\r\n\r\n- Personality Traits:\r\n  - Ruthless & Cruel\r\n  - Demanding & Perfectionistic\r\n  - Traditionalist\r\n  - Uncaring (except for Iroh)\r\n\r\n- Notable Quotes:\r\n  - \"You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born? ... Your punishment has scarcely begun!\"",

This forged her into a pragmatic and ruthlessly effective Avatar who valued justice above all else.

    "expandedView": "- Name: Yangchen\r\n- Nation: Air Nomads\r\n- Age: Unknown (Adult)\r\n- Overview: Burdened from a young age by the voices and memories of her past lives, Yangchen grew into a pragmatic and formidable Avatar. Unlike many Air Nomads, she was not a strict pacifist and understood that maintaining peace sometimes required manipulation, espionage, and force. Her tireless efforts and difficult compromises secured an entire generation of peace after her death, though her focus on humanity's problems inadvertently led to a rise in dark spirits for her successor, Kuruk.\r\n\r\n- Narrative Highlights:\r\n  - Plagued by visions of her past lives since childhood.\r\n  - Defeated the spirit General Old Iron and established a pact to protect his sacred land.\r\n  - Became deeply involved in the complex politics of the four nations to prevent war.\r\n  - Was so effective as the Avatar that no major wars occurred for a generation after her death.\r\n\r\n- Role in the Story: A legendary past Avatar who serves as a crucial spiritual guide, offering a pragmatic and duty-bound perspective that contrasts with Aang's idealism.\r\n\r\n- Relationships:\r\n  - Kuruk (Successor)\r\n  - Szeto (Predecessor)\r\n  - Kavik (Companion, Informant)\r\n  - Jetsun (Older Sister Figure, Spiritual Guide)\r\n\r\n- Personality Traits:\r\n  - Dutiful & Determined\r\n  - Compassionate & Empathetic\r\n  - Pragmatic & Shrewd\r\n  - Spiritually Troubled\r\n\r\n- Notable Quotes:\r\n  - \"Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs and do whatever it takes to protect the world.\"\r\n  - \"Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment. But the Avatar can never do it.\"\r\n  - \"All Avatars are connected, like a chain. When you broke off your relationship with Roku, you damaged your connection with all of us.\"",
