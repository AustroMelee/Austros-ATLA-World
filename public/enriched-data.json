In addition to being chased by Zuko, a Fire Nation blockade led by Zhao attacks them but does not manage to stop them. Arriving at the temple, Aang is shocked to learn that the five Fire Sages which tend the temple are no longer the Avatar's allies. However, one sage who remains loyal, Shyu, helps Aang to reach the sanctuary where he is to speak with the past Avatar. Roku informs Aang about Sozin's Comet, which gave the Fire Nation the power to start the war one hundred years prior and will give them power again to finish it upon its arrival at summer's end. Aang defeats Zhao, Zuko, and the sages when he manifests the spirit of Roku, who destroys the temple.\r\n\r\n### 📖 Synopsis\r\n\r\n**The Journey Begins:**\r\nOn the morning of the solstice, Aang attempts to convince Appa to fly to the Fire Temple alone, not wanting to endanger his friends' lives. After being stopped by Katara, Sokka, and the villagers of Senlin Village, Aang adamantly states that Avatar Roku can tell him the meaning of his vision of a comet. The siblings eventually agree to accompany him, and the village leader provides supplies, urging them to leave immediately to reach the temple before the solstice ends.\r\n\r\n### 🔥 Fire Nation Blockade\r\nAs Appa flies through the sky, Katara spots Zuko's ship trailing them. Iroh scolds Zuko for entering Fire Nation waters while banished, but Zuko refuses to turn back. They encounter a blockade commanded by Zhao, who recognizes both Appa and Zuko's ship and orders his ships to fire on the Avatar. Despite the barrage of attacks, Aang successfully navigates through the blockade, while Zuko's ship is damaged but continues pursuit.\r\n\r\n### 🏛️ Arrival at the Fire Temple\r\nAppa finally reaches the crescent-shaped island where Roku's temple is located. When they enter the temple, they are confronted by five Fire Sages who attack them. However, one sage named Shyu reveals he is on their side and helps them escape through a secret passageway. Shyu explains that when Fire Lord Sozin started the Hundred Year War, he forced the sages to serve him, and only Shyu's family remained loyal to the Avatar.\r\n\r\n### 🚪 The Sanctuary Door\r\nShyu leads them to a huge door that requires either a fully realized Avatar or five fire blasts from five different firebenders to open. Sokka devises a plan using five oil-based bombs, but the explosion doesn't open the door. Shyu then tricks the other sages into opening the door by claiming the Avatar has entered, only to discover the shadow was Momo crawling through the pipes.\r\n\r\n### 👤 Meeting Avatar Roku\r\nAs the sages open the door, Zuko appears restraining Aang. However, Aang breaks free and vaults through the closing doors into Roku's sanctuary. Inside, Aang calls out to Roku for help, and as sunlight spreads over the statue's face, its eyes glow white and Roku's spirit appears before Aang.\r\n\r\n### 🔮 The Prophecy\r\nRoku explains the significance of Sozin's Comet, which appeared a hundred years prior and greatly amplified firebenders' abilities, allowing Fire Lord Sozin to start the Hundred Year War. He reveals that the comet will return by the end of summer, and if left unchecked, Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to conquer the world. Aang must master water, earth, and fire before summer's end to restore balance to the world.\r\n\r\n### ⚡ Roku's Manifestation\r\nOutside the chamber, Zhao and his soldiers prepare to attack Aang when he emerges. However, Avatar Roku manifests in Aang's body instead, taking control of their fire and sending it back at them with great force. Roku then destroys the temple by splitting the ground and bringing magma up from the volcano below.\r\n\r\n### 🏁 Aftermath\r\nAs the temple collapses, Appa and Momo rescue the group, and they fly away as the temple falls into the lava. Zhao, enraged at his failure, arrests all five Fire Sages for letting the Avatar escape. Zuko watches as the Avatar flies away, and that night on Appa, Katara and Sokka comfort the exhausted Aang.\r\n\r\n### 🎭 Key Characters\r\n\r\n- **Aang** - The Avatar who seeks guidance from Roku\r\n- **Avatar Roku** - The previous Avatar who provides crucial information about Sozin's Comet\r\n- **Shyu** - The loyal Fire Sage who helps Aang reach the sanctuary\r\n- **Zuko** - The banished prince who pursues the Avatar\r\n- **Zhao** - The Fire Nation commander who leads the blockade\r\n- **Katara & Sokka** - Aang's companions who accompany him on the journey\r\n\r\n### 🌟 Significance\r\n\r\nThis episode is a major turning point in the series as it:\r\n- Introduces Sozin's Comet and establishes the time limit for Aang's training\r\n- Reveals the Fire Sages' betrayal of the Avatar\r\n- Shows the first manifestation of a past Avatar through Aang\r\n- Establishes the stakes for the entire series\r\n- Marks the first time Aang speaks while in the Avatar State\r\n\r\n### 🎬 Production Notes\r\n\r\n- This is the first time Fire Lord Ozai is shown (as a silhouette)\r\n- The Buddhist chant \"Na Mo A Mi Tuo Fo Shin Di\" is heard for the first time\r\n- This episode marks the first day of winter in the Avatar World\r\n- Aang speaks while in the Avatar State for the first time",

These bats are social animals, often forming large colonies in cave ceilings and working together to hunt and protect their territory.\r\n\r\n### 🍖 Diet & Hunting\r\n\r\nThese bats are carnivorous predators, feeding on a variety of prey including small mammals, birds, insects, and other cave-dwelling creatures. They use their sharp teeth and powerful jaws to capture and consume prey, often hunting in groups to take down larger animals. Wolfbats are also known to scavenge carrion when fresh prey is scarce.\r\n\r\n### 📏 Size & Physical Characteristics\r\n\r\nWolfbats are large bats, with wingspans reaching 3-4 feet and body lengths of 1-2 feet. They have distinctive snub-nosed faces with large, sensitive ears adapted for echolocation. Their fur is typically dark brown or black, providing camouflage in cave environments. They have powerful wings and sharp claws for gripping cave walls.\r\n\r\n### ⏰ Lifespan & Reproduction\r\n\r\nThese bats typically live 10-15 years in the wild. They form social colonies and breed seasonally, with females giving birth to 1-2 pups per year. Young bats are cared for by the entire colony and learn to fly and hunt from their parents and other colony members.\r\n\r\n### 🛡️ Conservation Status\r\n\r\nWolfbats are considered a species of least concern, with stable populations in their cave habitats. However, disturbance of cave systems and habitat destruction have led to some population declines. Conservation efforts focus on protecting cave ecosystems and regulating human access to sensitive bat habitats.\r\n\r\n### 🔗 Relations & Interactions\r\n\r\n- **Prey**: Small mammals, birds, insects, cave-dwelling creatures, carrion\r\n- **Predators**: Large cave predators, humans (occasionally)\r\n- **Competitors**: Other cave-dwelling predators\r\n- **Symbiotic**: Help control populations of cave-dwelling insects and small animals\r\n\r\n### 🌟 Notable Examples\r\n\r\nWhile no specific Wolfbats are mentioned in historical records, they are a common sight in the Cave of Two Lovers and other Earth Kingdom cave systems, frequently referenced in cave exploration guides and local folklore."

Its soldiers, ships, and commanders are the most frequent obstacles faced by Team Avatar. The military represents the overwhelming and oppressive power of Fire Lord Ozai's regime, and its various specialized units, like the Southern Raiders and Yuyan Archers, provide specific and dangerous threats to the heroes.\r\n\r\n### 🌟 Notable Members\r\n\r\n- General Iroh (formerly)\r\n- Admiral Zhao\r\n- Princess Azula\r\n- Colonel Mongke (Rough Rhinos)\r\n- Yon Rha (Southern Raiders)\r\n- Colonel Shinu (Yuyan Archers)"
