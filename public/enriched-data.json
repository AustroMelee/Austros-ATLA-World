In addition to being chased by Zuko, a Fire Nation blockade led by Zhao attacks them but does not manage to stop them. Arriving at the temple, Aang is shocked to learn that the five Fire Sages which tend the temple are no longer the Avatar's allies. However, one sage who remains loyal, Shyu, helps Aang to reach the sanctuary where he is to speak with the past Avatar. Roku informs Aang about Sozin's Comet, which gave the Fire Nation the power to start the war one hundred years prior and will give them power again to finish it upon its arrival at summer's end. Aang defeats Zhao, Zuko, and the sages when he manifests the spirit of Roku, who destroys the temple.\r\n\r\n### üìñ Synopsis\r\n\r\n**The Journey Begins:**\r\nOn the morning of the solstice, Aang attempts to convince Appa to fly to the Fire Temple alone, not wanting to endanger his friends' lives. After being stopped by Katara, Sokka, and the villagers of Senlin Village, Aang adamantly states that Avatar Roku can tell him the meaning of his vision of a comet. The siblings eventually agree to accompany him, and the village leader provides supplies, urging them to leave immediately to reach the temple before the solstice ends.\r\n\r\n### üî• Fire Nation Blockade\r\nAs Appa flies through the sky, Katara spots Zuko's ship trailing them. Iroh scolds Zuko for entering Fire Nation waters while banished, but Zuko refuses to turn back. They encounter a blockade commanded by Zhao, who recognizes both Appa and Zuko's ship and orders his ships to fire on the Avatar. Despite the barrage of attacks, Aang successfully navigates through the blockade, while Zuko's ship is damaged but continues pursuit.\r\n\r\n### üèõÔ∏è Arrival at the Fire Temple\r\nAppa finally reaches the crescent-shaped island where Roku's temple is located. When they enter the temple, they are confronted by five Fire Sages who attack them. However, one sage named Shyu reveals he is on their side and helps them escape through a secret passageway. Shyu explains that when Fire Lord Sozin started the Hundred Year War, he forced the sages to serve him, and only Shyu's family remained loyal to the Avatar.\r\n\r\n### üö™ The Sanctuary Door\r\nShyu leads them to a huge door that requires either a fully realized Avatar or five fire blasts from five different firebenders to open. Sokka devises a plan using five oil-based bombs, but the explosion doesn't open the door. Shyu then tricks the other sages into opening the door by claiming the Avatar has entered, only to discover the shadow was Momo crawling through the pipes.\r\n\r\n### üë§ Meeting Avatar Roku\r\nAs the sages open the door, Zuko appears restraining Aang. However, Aang breaks free and vaults through the closing doors into Roku's sanctuary. Inside, Aang calls out to Roku for help, and as sunlight spreads over the statue's face, its eyes glow white and Roku's spirit appears before Aang.\r\n\r\n### üîÆ The Prophecy\r\nRoku explains the significance of Sozin's Comet, which appeared a hundred years prior and greatly amplified firebenders' abilities, allowing Fire Lord Sozin to start the Hundred Year War. He reveals that the comet will return by the end of summer, and if left unchecked, Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to conquer the world. Aang must master water, earth, and fire before summer's end to restore balance to the world.\r\n\r\n### ‚ö° Roku's Manifestation\r\nOutside the chamber, Zhao and his soldiers prepare to attack Aang when he emerges. However, Avatar Roku manifests in Aang's body instead, taking control of their fire and sending it back at them with great force. Roku then destroys the temple by splitting the ground and bringing magma up from the volcano below.\r\n\r\n### üèÅ Aftermath\r\nAs the temple collapses, Appa and Momo rescue the group, and they fly away as the temple falls into the lava. Zhao, enraged at his failure, arrests all five Fire Sages for letting the Avatar escape. Zuko watches as the Avatar flies away, and that night on Appa, Katara and Sokka comfort the exhausted Aang.\r\n\r\n### üé≠ Key Characters\r\n\r\n- **Aang** - The Avatar who seeks guidance from Roku\r\n- **Avatar Roku** - The previous Avatar who provides crucial information about Sozin's Comet\r\n- **Shyu** - The loyal Fire Sage who helps Aang reach the sanctuary\r\n- **Zuko** - The banished prince who pursues the Avatar\r\n- **Zhao** - The Fire Nation commander who leads the blockade\r\n- **Katara & Sokka** - Aang's companions who accompany him on the journey\r\n\r\n### üåü Significance\r\n\r\nThis episode is a major turning point in the series as it:\r\n- Introduces Sozin's Comet and establishes the time limit for Aang's training\r\n- Reveals the Fire Sages' betrayal of the Avatar\r\n- Shows the first manifestation of a past Avatar through Aang\r\n- Establishes the stakes for the entire series\r\n- Marks the first time Aang speaks while in the Avatar State\r\n\r\n### üé¨ Production Notes\r\n\r\n- This is the first time Fire Lord Ozai is shown (as a silhouette)\r\n- The Buddhist chant \"Na Mo A Mi Tuo Fo Shin Di\" is heard for the first time\r\n- This episode marks the first day of winter in the Avatar World\r\n- Aang speaks while in the Avatar State for the first time",
