## Version History

### Version 1.2.1 - Code Quality & Architecture Cleanup
**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** Medium  

#### 🔧 **Architecture Improvements**
**Problem:** Multiple band-aid/temporary fixes were implemented during debugging sessions that needed proper cleanup and refactoring.

**Issues Cleaned Up:**
1. **Cache-busting comments** in `main.js` that were temporary debugging artifacts
2. **Direct event handlers** in `INDEX.HTML` that bypassed the proper main.js initialization
3. **Excessive debug logging** that cluttered the console output
4. **Cache-busting imports** with timestamp/random parameters that were no longer needed

**Technical Fixes Applied:**
- **main.js Cleanup:** Removed cache-busting comments and replaced with proper JSDoc documentation
- **HTML Simplification:** Removed direct handlers and restored proper module loading through main.js
- **Logging Optimization:** Reduced verbose debug output to essential information only
- **Error Handling:** Added user-friendly error display for module loading failures

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- ✅ **Proper Module Loading** - All event handlers now go through main.js initialization
- ✅ **Clean Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages with fallback UI
- ✅ **Reduced Debug Noise** - Essential logging only, removed development artifacts
- ✅ **Architecture Consistency** - All functionality properly routed through centralized initialization

**Result:** The codebase is now production-ready with no temporary fixes or debugging artifacts remaining.

### Version 1.2.0 - Battle Log Display Fix
**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** High  

#### 🐛 **Issue Summary**
**Problem:** Battle logs were not appearing below the FIGHT button after clicking "FIGHT" in both Animated and Instant simulation modes.

**User Impact:** 
- ✅ Users could see the battle results modal/dialog 
- ❌ No battle logs appeared in the simulation container below the FIGHT button
- ❌ Incomplete user experience - users expected detailed battle logs in main interface

#### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
**Primary Issue:** The `renderSimulationState()` function in `js/state_manager.js` had flawed logic for when to show the simulation container.

**Technical Details:**
1. **Original Logic:** Only showed simulation container for `animated mode + simulation.isRunning`
2. **Problem:** Never showed container for completed battles or instant mode results
3. **Result:** Battle logs had nowhere to be displayed below the FIGHT button

**Console Evidence:**
- Battle simulation completed successfully ✅
- Results dialog opened correctly ✅  
- All state management worked ✅
- But simulation container remained hidden ❌

#### 🛠️ **Technical Fix Applied**
**File Modified:** `js/state_manager.js`

**Before (Broken Logic):**
```javascript
// Only showed for animated mode during simulation
const shouldShow = (ui.mode === 'animated' && simulation.isRunning);
```

**After (Fixed Logic):**
```javascript
// Show for animated mode (during simulation OR when results available)
// AND for instant mode when results are available
const shouldShow = (ui.mode === 'animated' && (simulation.isRunning || 
                   (ui.resultsVisible && battle.battleLog && battle.battleLog.length > 0))) || 
                  (ui.mode === 'instant' && ui.resultsVisible && battle.battleLog && battle.battleLog.length > 0);
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Expanded Visibility Logic:** Container now shows for completed battles in both modes
2. **Universal Log Population:** Battle logs populate for both animated and instant modes
3. **Enhanced Debug Logging:** Added console messages to track container state
4. **Defensive Programming:** Added proper null checks and fallbacks

#### ✅ **Testing Verification**
**Console Messages Confirming Success:**
```
[STATE] Simulation container shown for mode: animated
[STATE] animated mode battle log populated in simulation container
[STATE] Detailed battle logs populated successfully
[STATE] Dialog showModal() called successfully
```

**Visual Confirmation:**
- ✅ Battle logs visible in styled container below FIGHT button
- ✅ Proper narrative formatting and character styling
- ✅ Both modes (animated/instant) working correctly

#### 🎮 **Final User Experience**
**Before Fix:**
- Click FIGHT → Only see modal dialog
- No logs visible in main interface

**After Fix:**
- Click FIGHT → Modal dialog opens ✅
- Battle logs appear below FIGHT button ✅
- Complete, immersive experience ✅

### Version 1.1.x - Previous JavaScript Debugging Session
**Date:** June 17-18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** Critical  

#### 🐛 **Issue Summary**
Multiple JavaScript errors preventing application from loading, including syntax errors, module import issues, and browser caching problems.

#### 🛠️ **Major Fixes Applied**
1. **File Encoding Issues:** Fixed Unicode BOM/encoding problems in multiple JS files
2. **ES6 Module Import/Export Mismatches:** Corrected import paths and function exports
3. **Missing Function References:** Added missing function definitions and imports
4. **Browser Caching Problems:** Implemented cache-busting and direct handlers
5. **Runtime Errors:** Applied defensive programming with optional chaining

#### ✅ **Outcome**
- ✅ Application loads successfully
- ✅ All JavaScript modules working
- ✅ Battle simulation engine functional
- ✅ Character and location displays working
