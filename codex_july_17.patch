 - Performance was poor due to excessive DOM manipulation
 - The new Canvas solution is 80 lines, truly random, and much more performant
 
 **Can I disable the Matrix Rain effect?**
 - The effect respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting
 - Users with motion sensitivity will see a static or minimal version
 - The application maintains full functionality without the animated background
 
 **How do glassmorphism effects work?**
 - Cards use `backdrop-filter: blur()` for the frosted glass effect
 - Semi-transparent backgrounds allow the Matrix rain to show through
 - Hover states add Matrix green glow with multiple box-shadow layers
 - Cross-browser support includes Safari `-webkit-backdrop-filter` fallbacks
 
 **What happens if my browser doesn't support backdrop filters?**
 - The application gracefully falls back to higher opacity backgrounds
 - All functionality remains intact with slightly less transparency
 - Modern browsers (Chrome 76+, Firefox 103+, Safari 9+) fully support the effects
 
 **Are there any performance considerations?**
 - The Matrix Rain uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 30fps animation
 - Canvas rendering is hardware-accelerated with `will-change: transform`
 - Window resize events are properly debounced to prevent excessive recalculations
 - Memory cleanup occurs on component unmount to prevent leaks
