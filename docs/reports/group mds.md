### üìñ Overview

The Dai Li is the elite secret police force of Ba Sing Se, originally founded by Avatar Kyoshi to protect the city's cultural heritage. Over time, the organization became corrupt and ruthless. During the Hundred Year War, they fell under the control of Grand Secretariat Long Feng, enforcing a police state within the capital and suppressing all mention of the war. Their loyalty was so detached from the Earth Kingdom that they eventually sided with Princess Azula, aiding the Fire Nation in the successful Coup of Ba Sing Se.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Founding:** Created by Avatar Kyoshi between 270 and 82 BG to preserve Ba Sing Se's culture after a peasant uprising.
- **Corruption:** Exploited by Long Feng to take control of Ba Sing Se, reducing the Earth King to a figurehead.
- **Conspiracy of Ba Sing Se:** Actively suppressed any mention of the Hundred Year War within the city walls and brainwashed dissidents under Lake Laogai.
- **Coup of Ba Sing Se:** Betrayed Long Feng to ally with Princess Azula, assisting the Fire Nation in conquering the city.
- **Allegiance to Azula:** Served as Princess Azula's personal bodyguards in the Fire Nation until being banished by her during a paranoid breakdown.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Dai Li serve as primary antagonists during the Ba Sing Se arc. They are the physical embodiment of the city's corruption, hindering Team Avatar's attempts to see the Earth King and enforcing Long Feng's conspiracy of silence about the war. Their formidable earthbending skills and ruthless tactics make them a significant threat, culminating in their critical role in Azula's defeat of Aang in the Crystal Catacombs.

### üìñ Overview

The Order of the White Lotus is an ancient and formerly secret society that transcends the boundaries of the four nations. Formed by scholars and masters from around the world, the group is dedicated to the pursuit of philosophy, beauty, and truth. Members communicate their affiliation through the strategic placement of tiles in the game of Pai Sho. While historically operating from the shadows to guide and protect the Avatar, the Order revealed itself publicly at the end of the Hundred Year War to liberate Ba Sing Se from Fire Nation control.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Ancient Origins:** Formed as a club for ancient masters to challenge one another at Pai Sho.
- **Hundred Year War:** Maintained a low profile, with key members like Iroh joining its ranks.
- **Liberation of Ba Sing Se:** Under the leadership of Grand Lotus Iroh, the Order's masters united and retook the Earth Kingdom capital from the Fire Nation during Sozin's Comet.
- **Public Debut:** After the war, the society stopped concealing itself and began to serve the world and the Avatar more openly.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Order of the White Lotus serves as a powerful, benevolent force that reveals itself in the final act of the Hundred Year War. They represent a level of wisdom and cooperation that transcends national conflict. Their intervention is crucial, as they single-handedly liberate Ba Sing Se, demonstrating the combined strength of the world's greatest masters and providing critical support to Team Avatar's final mission.

### üìñ Overview

The military of the Water Tribe comprises the distinct forces of the Northern Water Tribe and the Southern Water Tribe. The North maintained a large, organized standing army and navy protected within the walls of Agna Qel'a. The South, devastated by Fire Nation raids, relied on a smaller, mobile militia of warriors who left home to fight. Though their equipment was less advanced than the Fire Nation's, their warriors were courageous, and their waterbenders used the polar environment to their advantage, making them formidable defenders of their homelands.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Early Hundred Year War:** The combined Water Tribe fleets were defeated by the Fire Nation Navy, isolating the tribes.
- **Southern Water Tribe Raids:** The Southern military was decimated and its benders captured, leading to a force of nonbending warriors.
- **Siege of the North:** The Northern Tribe's military, with the help of Team Avatar, successfully repelled a massive invasion led by Admiral Zhao.
- **Invasion of the Fire Nation:** Southern warriors, led by Hakoda, joined the coalition force for the failed invasion on the Day of Black Sun.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Water Tribe military represents the resilience and defiance of a people under siege. The Southern warriors, particularly Hakoda and Sokka's storyline, embody the sacrifice required to fight a global war. The Northern military's stand during the Siege of the North is a pivotal moment in the series, showcasing the power of waterbending on a massive scale and resulting in the spiritual transformation of Princess Yue.

### üìñ Overview

The military of the Fire Nation is the unified armed forces of the nation, comprising a massive army, the world's largest navy, and the first functional air force. As the primary instrument of the Fire Lord's will, it was responsible for prosecuting the Hundred Year War, committing atrocities such as the Air Nomad Genocide and the Southern Water Tribe raids. Its strength was derived from its vast number of firebenders, industrial superiority, advanced technology like tanks and airships, and aggressive military doctrine.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Start of the War:** Under Fire Lord Sozin, the military carried out the Air Nomad Genocide, wiping out an entire nation.
- **Naval Dominance:** Defeated the Water Tribe fleets early in the war, securing control over the world's oceans.
- **Siege of the North:** Launched a massive but unsuccessful invasion of the Northern Water Tribe led by Admiral Zhao.
- **Technological Advancement:** Developed and deployed war balloons, tanks, and massive airships, revolutionizing warfare.
- **Fall of Ba Sing Se:** Successfully conquered the Earth Kingdom capital through a coup led by Princess Azula and the Dai Li.
- **Final Campaign:** Attempted to burn the Earth Kingdom continent under the power of Sozin's Comet, but was defeated by Team Avatar.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Fire Nation military serves as the primary antagonistic force for the entire series. Its soldiers, ships, and commanders are the most frequent obstacles faced by Team Avatar. The military represents the overwhelming and oppressive power of Fire Lord Ozai's regime, and its various specialized units, like the Southern Raiders and Yuyan Archers, provide specific and dangerous threats to the heroes.

### üìñ Overview

The military of the Earth Kingdom is the vast armed forces responsible for defending the continent. Commanded by the Council of Five in Ba Sing Se, it is the largest army in the world by sheer numbers. It consists of earthbenders, non-bending foot soldiers, and specialized cavalry. Though technologically inferior to the Fire Nation, the Earth Kingdom military was able to hold out for a century through stalwart defense, guerrilla tactics, and the sheer determination of its soldiers. The military includes several specialized divisions, such as the Kyoshi Warriors and the Royal Earthbender Guards.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Hundred Year War:** Fought a century-long defensive war against the Fire Nation, suffering many defeats but preventing a total collapse for 100 years.
- **Siege of Ba Sing Se (95 AG):** Successfully repelled General Iroh's legendary siege of the capital city.
- **Battle of the Drill:** With help from Team Avatar, successfully defended Ba Sing Se's Outer Wall from a massive Fire Nation drill.
- **Coup of Ba Sing Se (100 AG):** The military's high command, the Council of Five, was neutralized by the Dai Li, leading to the city's fall and the army's fragmentation.
- **Day of Black Sun:** Remnant forces joined the invasion of the Fire Nation, but were captured after its failure.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Earth Kingdom military represents the primary force of resistance against the Fire Nation. Its soldiers and generals are frequent allies to Team Avatar, though some, like General Fong, prove to be misguided. The military's struggle highlights the immense scale of the war and the resilience of the Earth Kingdom people. Specialized groups within the military, like the Kyoshi Warriors, serve as important recurring allies.

### üìñ Overview

The Si Wong tribes, also known as sandbenders, are the nomadic people indigenous to the vast Si Wong Desert. They have adapted to the harsh environment, developing a unique form of earthbending to manipulate loose sand. They travel across the dunes on wind-powered sand-sailers. While some tribes act as guides, others have turned to raiding and scavenging to survive, giving them a poor reputation among outsiders. Their culture is distinct, with unique protective clothing and goggles to survive the desert sun.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Ancient History:** Became the predominant ethnic group in the desert, maintaining a relationship with Wan Shi Tong's Spirit Library.
- **Deteriorating Relations:** Were eventually banned from the Spirit Library after outsiders they guided sought knowledge for personal gain.
- **Appa's Capture:** A group of sandbenders captured Appa and traded him to beetle-headed merchants, which led to a confrontation with an enraged Avatar Aang.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Si Wong tribes are introduced as a neutral, opportunistic force. Their capture of Appa creates a major emotional crisis for Aang and a significant plot arc for the team as they are stranded in the desert. The confrontation with the sandbenders showcases a darker, more vengeful side of Aang when he enters the Avatar State out of grief and anger, highlighting the depth of his bond with Appa.

### üìñ Overview

The Kyoshi Warriors are an order of elite female fighters dedicated to protecting their home, Kyoshi Island. Founded by Avatar Kyoshi herself, they honor her legacy by wearing her iconic kabuki-style makeup and green armor. Despite being non-benders, they are formidable combatants, utilizing metal fans and a unique fighting style that turns an opponent's strength against them. Led by Suki, they are initially isolationist but later join the war effort, becoming valuable allies to Team Avatar.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Founding:** Established by Avatar Kyoshi to protect her home island.
- **Encounter with Team Avatar:** Initially capture the team but later befriend them, with Suki training Sokka.
- **Joining the War:** Left Kyoshi Island to help fight the Fire Nation, aiding refugees across the Serpent's Pass.
- **Capture and Imprisonment:** Suki and the other warriors were captured by Azula's forces and imprisoned at the Boiling Rock.
- **Liberation and Final Battle:** Suki was rescued from the Boiling Rock by Sokka and Zuko, and she and the other warriors later assisted in disabling the Fire Nation airship fleet during the finale.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Kyoshi Warriors serve as important recurring allies to Team Avatar. They represent the strength and capability of non-benders in a world dominated by bending. Their leader, Suki, becomes a key member of the group and Sokka's love interest. Their journey from isolationist protectors to active participants in the war demonstrates the conflict's global reach and the need for everyone to contribute to the fight for balance.

### üìñ Overview

The Freedom Fighters were a small, independent group of teenage rebels who fought against the Fire Nation in the forests of the Earth Kingdom. Led by the charismatic but vengeful Jet, they used guerrilla tactics to sabotage Fire Nation operations. Their methods were often extreme, culminating in a plan to flood a Fire Nation-occupied village, which would have killed innocent civilians. After Jet's death, the remaining members joined the larger resistance movement.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Formation:** Formed by Jet and other orphans of the war to fight the Fire Nation.
- **Encounter with Team Avatar:** Befriended Team Avatar but were abandoned after their plan to destroy a dam was revealed.
- **Relocation to Ba Sing Se:** Traveled to the capital city, where Jet was captured, brainwashed, and ultimately killed by the Dai Li.
- **Day of Black Sun:** The remaining members joined the invasion force against the Fire Nation.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Freedom Fighters serve as a cautionary tale about the cost of war and how a desire for justice can curdle into extremism. They present Team Avatar with a moral dilemma, forcing them to confront the idea that not all who fight the Fire Nation are necessarily noble. Jet's tragic arc, from rebel leader to brainwashed pawn, highlights the insidious nature of the Ba Sing Se conspiracy.

### üìñ Overview

The Yuyan Archers are an elite special task force within the Fire Nation Army. Commanded by Colonel Shinu, they are legendary for their unparalleled skill in archery. Admiral Zhao claimed they were capable of pinning a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away without killing it, a testament to their precision and discipline. Their primary role is to capture high-value targets, and they were deployed by Zhao to capture Avatar Aang.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Capture of Avatar Aang:** Successfully captured Aang on Zhao's orders, demonstrating their formidable skill by overwhelming him, though he later escaped with the help of the Blue Spirit.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Yuyan Archers serve to establish the high level of skill and specialization within the Fire Nation military. Their successful capture of a fully alert Avatar Aang demonstrates that even powerful benders are vulnerable to highly skilled non-benders, raising the stakes of the conflict. Their appearance is brief but memorable, showcasing them as one of the most elite forces in the world.

### üìñ Overview

The Rough Rhinos were an elite cavalry unit within the Fire Nation military, founded and led by Colonel Mongke. The group consisted of five members, each a specialist with a unique weapon, including an archer, a rock-flail wielder, and a explosives expert. They were renowned for their skill and their ability to ride their komodo rhino mounts silently through the brush, making them an effective raiding and intimidation force.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Terrorizing Earth Kingdom Villages:** Under Colonel Mongke, they were tasked with intimidating Earth Kingdom villages and suppressing resistance.
- **Confrontation with Iroh:** The unit was famously defeated by General Iroh, who was defending a village.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Rough Rhinos are introduced as a veteran, intimidating force representing the Fire Nation's control over conquered Earth Kingdom territory. Their defeat at the hands of Iroh serves to establish his immense power, wisdom, and compassionate nature, as he chooses to defend the innocent rather than continue his siege of Ba Sing Se. They act as a benchmark for what a truly powerful master can accomplish.

### üìñ Overview

The Southern Raiders were an elite and ruthless unit of the Fire Nation Navy. Their specific mission during the Hundred Year War was to conduct numerous raids on the Southern Water Tribe with the primary objective of capturing and eliminating every last waterbender. They were distinguished by their unique sea raven insignia and modified black and red armor. The Raiders were responsible for the death of Katara and Sokka's mother, Kya, an event that profoundly shaped Katara's character.

### ‚ú® Historical Milestones

- **Southern Water Tribe Raids:** Systematically attacked the Southern Water Tribe over many years, capturing all of its waterbenders.
- **Murder of Kya:** The commander of the Raiders at the time, Yon Rha, personally killed Katara's mother after she claimed to be the last waterbender to protect her daughter.

### üé≠ Role in the Narrative

The Southern Raiders are a deeply personal antagonist group for Katara. While the Fire Nation military is a general foe, the Raiders represent the specific evil that destroyed her family and her culture's bending heritage. Katara and Zuko's hunt for the retired commander Yon Rha is a crucial moment for Katara's character development, forcing her to confront her desire for revenge and ultimately choose forgiveness, which solidifies her trust in Zuko.

### üåü Notable Members
