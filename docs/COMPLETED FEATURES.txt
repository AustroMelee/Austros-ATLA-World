## **1. BATTLE STATE AWARENESS**

*“Each agent sees the full tactical field—HP, buffs, cooldowns, last actions, the whole board.”*

---

### **A. Define Battle State Models**

Battle Awareness Completion Checklist
1. Full-State Perception
 AI Receives Perceived State:
Every AI decision function receives a single PerceivedBattleState object (or equivalent), containing:

Both agents’ HP, max HP, defense, chi/resources.

Active buffs & debuffs (by name, ideally with effect).

Cooldowns (all relevant abilities, with remaining turns).

Last move, move history for both agents.

Turn number, and (optionally) a window of recent battleLog entries.

- SRP pass complete: All major services and modules now follow strict single-responsibility boundaries. Tactical move, narrative, and AI systems are fully modular.
