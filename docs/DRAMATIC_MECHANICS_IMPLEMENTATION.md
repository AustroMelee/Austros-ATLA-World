> All mechanics are now fully implemented, including Reversal. See below for details.

### Reversal Mechanic (Implemented)
- **Trigger:** When a character (Aang or Azula) is in a compromised state and low stability, a reversal can occur, turning the tide of battle.
- **Log Example:** `T23 Aang: Reversal`, `T29 Azula: Reversal`
- **AI/Personality:** Aang is more likely to trigger a reversal when desperate; Azula can also trigger reversals, especially in high-risk moments.
- **Effect:** Regains stability, shifts control, and is logged as a dramatic event.
- **Integration:** Fully integrated with disruption-first, narrative-driven battle flow.

## Overview
Successfully implemented truly dramatic and mechanically meaningful battle mechanics that go beyond mere narrative flair. The system now includes real crit multipliers, conditional finisher moves, desperation buffs, and enhanced battle flow.

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Enhanced Ability Types (`src/common/types/index.ts`)
- **Critical Hit System**: Added `critChance` and `critMultiplier` properties
- **Finisher Moves**: Added `isFinisher`, `oncePerBattle`, and `finisherCondition` properties
- **Desperation Mechanics**: Added `desperationBuff` with damage bonus and defense penalty
- **Conditional Unlocking**: Moves can now unlock based on health thresholds

### 2. Updated Character Data (`src/features/character-selection/data/characterData.ts`)
- **Aang's Moves**: 5 airbending moves with meaningful stats
  - Basic Strike: 1 damage, 12% crit chance, 3x multiplier
  - Air Blast: 2 damage, 15% crit chance, 2.5x multiplier
  - Wind Slice: 4 damage, 18% crit chance, 2.5x multiplier
  - Air Tornado: 3 damage, desperation move (unlocks at 25% HP)
  - Last Breath Cyclone: 12 damage, finisher (unlocks at 20% HP, once per battle)

- **Azula's Moves**: 5 firebending moves with dramatic mechanics
  - Basic Strike: 1 damage, 10% crit chance, 3x multiplier
  - Blue Fire: 3 damage, 16% crit chance, 2.8x multiplier
  - Lightning Storm: 5 damage, 20% crit chance, 3x multiplier, desperation move
  - Phoenix Inferno: 15 damage, finisher (unlocks at 20% HP, once per battle)

### 3. New Move Logic Service (`src/features/battle-simulation/services/battle/moveLogic.service.ts`)
- **Real Critical Hits**: Actual damage multipliers (2x-3x damage)
- **Finisher Resolution**: Massive damage with dramatic narrative
- **Desperation Buffs**: Damage bonuses when HP is low
- **Conditional Logic**: Moves unlock based on battle state
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed battle log entries with mechanical effects

### 4. Integrated Battle System
- **Move Execution**: Updated to use new dramatic mechanics
- **AI Decision Making**: Enhanced to consider crit potential, finisher conditions, desperation moves
- **State Management**: Proper tracking of used finishers and desperation states
- **Battle Flow**: Real mechanical impact on damage, move availability, and battle progression

### 5. Enhanced Battle Types (`src/features/battle-simulation/types/index.ts`)
- **Battle Log Meta**: Added crit multipliers, finisher flags, desperation buffs
- **State Tracking**: Proper initialization of move uses and battle flags

## 🎯 MECHANICAL IMPACT

### Critical Hits
- **Real Damage**: 2x-3x damage multipliers instead of cosmetic effects
- **Strategic Value**: AI considers crit potential when choosing moves
- **Narrative Integration**: Critical hits generate dramatic battle log entries

### Finisher Moves
- **Conditional Unlocking**: Only available when health is below threshold (20% HP)
- **Once Per Battle**: Cannot be spammed, creates dramatic climax
- **Massive Damage**: 12-15 base damage with potential for crits
- **AI Awareness**: AI prioritizes finishers when conditions are met

### Desperation Moves
- **Health-Based Unlocking**: Moves unlock when HP drops below 25%
- **Damage Bonuses**: +2-3 damage when in desperation state
- **Defense Penalties**: Trade-off for increased offensive power
- **Strategic Depth**: Creates meaningful choices at low health

### Battle Flow
- **Progressive Unlocking**: Moves become available as battle progresses
- **Real Consequences**: Damage numbers actually matter for victory
- **Dynamic AI**: AI adapts to new move availability and conditions
- **Narrative Coherence**: Mechanical effects drive dramatic storytelling

## 🧪 TESTING VERIFICATION

Created test script that confirms:
- Critical hit calculation: 20% chance with 2.5x multiplier working correctly
- Desperation buff: +2 damage when HP ≤ 25% working correctly
- Combined effects: Base 3 damage → 7.5 (crit) + 2 (desperation) = 9.5 final damage

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

The dramatic mechanics are now fully integrated and functional. The battle system provides:
1. **Real Mechanical Impact**: Damage numbers, crits, and conditions actually matter
2. **Strategic Depth**: AI considers new mechanics when making decisions
3. **Dramatic Progression**: Battle flow evolves as conditions are met
4. **Narrative Integration**: Mechanical effects drive storytelling

The system is ready for testing and further refinement based on battle outcomes and user feedback.
