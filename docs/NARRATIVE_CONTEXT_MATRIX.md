# Narrative Context Matrix: "Avatar-Level" Upgrade

### Purpose
This matrix is the canonical guide for the game's narrative system. It maps every game mechanic and event to specific narrative lines, tones, and emotional states for each character. This ensures a rich, varied, and emotionally resonant experience that adapts to the flow of the battle, achieving an "Avatar-level" quality of storytelling.

**Contributors should use this document as the single source of truth for tone, style, and content when writing new lines.**

--- 

## Core Principles

1.  **Complete Coverage**: Every possible event must have multiple narrative lines.
2.  **Emotional Arc**: Narration must reflect the character's journey from calm to desperate.
3.  **Tactical Clarity**: The narration should tell the *story* of the fight, not just describe actions.
4.  **Anti-Repetition**: The player should never hear the same line for the same event back-to-back.
5.  **Character Voice**: Every line must sound authentic to the character saying it.

## ðŸ“‘ How to Use This Matrix

-   **Mechanic**: The game event that triggers the narration (e.g., `Lightning`, `ForcedEscalation`).
-   **Context**: The specific outcome of the mechanic (e.g., `hit`, `miss`, `chargeStart`).
-   **Emotional State**: The character's current mindset (e.g., `Calm`, `Cocky`, `Strained`, `Desperate`). Lines are chosen based on this state.
-   **Narrative Line Examples**: Sample lines that exemplify the required tone. The full pools are in the codebase.

## Character Voice Guide

### **Aang**
- **Tone**: Hopeful, reluctant, peaceful, but powerful and determined when pushed. Often speaks with a sense of duty and a desire for de-escalation.
- **Vocabulary**: "Balance," "peace," "sorry," "have to," references to spirits and airbending philosophy.
- **Emotional Arc**: Moves from calm and avoidance to resolute determination, and finally to desperate power (Avatar State).

### **Azula**
- **Tone**: Confident, cruel, precise, dominant, and condescending. She sees combat as a performance of perfection.
- **Vocabulary**: "Perfection," "pathetic," "weak," "predictable," taunts, commands.
- **Emotional Arc**: Moves from smug confidence to enraged frustration when her plans fail, and finally to unhinged, wild desperation when her control shatters.

### **Narrator / System**
- **Tone**: Epic, objective, and atmospheric. Sets the scene and describes events with a sense of weight and consequence.
- **Vocabulary**: Evocative, elemental, and grand (e.g., "The ancient stones bear witness," "A tempest of raw power").
