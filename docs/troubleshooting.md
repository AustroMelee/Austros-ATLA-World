## ðŸš¨ Non-Negotiable Tag Rule

**All tags in markdown files must be single, underscore-joined words.**
- No spaces, slashes, or multi-word phrases are allowed in any tag.
- Spaces and slashes are replaced with underscores (e.g., `water nation` â†’ `water_nation`).
- All tags are lowercased (e.g., `Firebender` â†’ `firebender`).
- This rule applies to all present and future markdown files.
- The enrichment/data pipeline will enforce this and strip or reject any non-compliant tags.
- **Example:**
  - Valid: `water_nation`, `firebender`, `main_villain`
  - Invalid: `water nation`, `main villain`, `main/villain`, `Main Villain`

## [2025-01-27] Character Names Being Cut Off in Card Display

**Symptom:**
Character names (e.g., "Headhunter") are being truncated in the card display, showing as "Headhun..." instead of the full name.

**Root Cause:**
The issue was caused by a combination of factors in the `ItemCardCollapsed.tsx` component:
1. **Deprecated line-clamp plugin**: The project was using `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` version 0.4.4, which is deprecated and may not work properly with newer Tailwind versions
2. **Inappropriate text sizing**: The name was using `text-lg` (18px) which was too large for the 113px wide card
3. **Flex layout issues**: The text container couldn't shrink properly due to missing `min-w-0` class
4. **Icon space allocation**: The NationIcon was taking up space in the flex container, leaving insufficient room for longer names

**Solution:**
The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. **Removed deprecated plugin**: Removed `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` from both `tailwind.config.js` and `package.json`
2. **Updated text display**: Changed from `text-lg line-clamp-2` to `text-sm` with `overflow-hidden text-ellipsis`
3. **Improved flex layout**: Added `flex-1 min-w-0` to the text container to allow proper shrinking
4. **Better overflow handling**: Used `overflow-hidden text-ellipsis` for graceful text truncation

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<h3 className="font-bold text-sm text-white leading-tight overflow-hidden text-ellipsis flex-1 min-w-0">
  {toTitleCase(item.name)}
</h3>
```

**Impact:**
- All character names now display properly without being cut off
- Longer names are gracefully truncated with ellipsis rather than being cut mid-word
- The smaller font size (`text-sm` instead of `text-lg`) provides more space for longer names
- The flex layout ensures proper space allocation between text and icons

## [2025-01-27] CRT Effects and Modal Interaction Issues

**Symptom:**
CRT effects (glow, dithering) not appearing, or modal click-to-close not working properly.

**Root Cause:**
The CRT effects rely on custom CSS utilities that may not be generated if Tailwind hasn't been rebuilt, or modal event handlers may have accessibility conflicts.

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **CRT Effects Not Visible:**
   - **Check:** Run `npm run build:tailwind` to regenerate CSS with new utility classes
   - **Verify:** Ensure `custom.css` contains the CRT utility definitions
   - **Browser:** Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
   - **Classes:** Verify components are using the correct class names:
     - `crt-glow-text` for text glow effects
     - `crt-glow-border` for border glow
     - `crt-dither` for container dithering
     - `crt-text-dither` for text dithering

2. **Search Bar Styling Issues:**
   - **Font:** Ensure Glass_TTY_VT220.ttf font is properly loaded in `custom.css`
   - **Text Size:** Search bar uses 28px font size with `py-2` padding for compact appearance
   - **Block Cursor:** Custom cursor should have 4px spacing from text end
   - **Spell Check:** `spellCheck={false}` should prevent browser underlining
   - **Text Selection:** Should use CRT green background with black text, not default blue
   - **Check:** Verify all CRT classes are applied: `crt-glow-border crt-dither crt-glow-text crt-text-dither`

3. **Scrollbars Not Themed:**
   - **Browser Support:** CRT scrollbar styling only works in Webkit browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
   - **Firefox:** Will use default scrollbars (expected behavior)
   - **Check:** Ensure CSS variables `--crt-green` and `--crt-green-glow` are defined

4. **Modal Click-to-Close Issues:**
   - **Symptom:** Clicking outside modal doesn't close it
   - **Check:** Ensure the invisible overlay button is properly positioned with `absolute inset-0`
   - **Events:** Verify event propagation is stopped on content clicks
   - **Accessibility:** Confirm keyboard navigation (Escape key) still works

5. **Nation-Colored Titles Not Appearing:**
   - **Check:** Verify `nationThemeMap` import in `ItemCardModal.tsx`
   - **Data:** Ensure character data includes proper `nation` field
   - **Fallback:** Should default to gray color if nation is undefined

6. **Text Display and Selection Issues:**
   - **Selection Color:** Text selection should show CRT green background with black text
   - **Terminal Aesthetic:** No spell-check underlining should appear on character names
   - **Text Truncation:** Names should use `text-sm` with proper ellipsis handling
   - **Check:** Verify custom selection CSS is applied globally

**Implementation Check:**
```tsx
// Verify these elements exist in SearchBar.tsx
className="crt-glow-border crt-dither crt-glow-text crt-text-dither"
spellCheck={false}
style={{ fontSize: '28px', caretColor: 'transparent' }}

// Verify these elements exist in ItemCardModal.tsx
style={{ color: titleColor }}
onClick={onClose} // On overlay
onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} // On content
```

**CSS Verification:**
```css
/* Check custom.css for these rules */
::selection {
  background-color: var(--crt-green);
  color: var(--search-bg);
}

.crt-glow-text { /* text glow effects */ }
.crt-glow-border { /* border glow effects */ }
.crt-dither { /* scan-line patterns */ }
```

**Impact:**
- All CRT effects should be visible and performant
- Modal interactions should be smooth and accessible
- Nation colors should provide immediate visual context
- Scrollbars should match the overall CRT aesthetic
- Search bar should provide authentic terminal experience without browser interference

## [2025-07-17] Character Badge/Role Not Displaying

**Symptom:**
Some character cards (e.g., Yagoda, Yu, Lo and Li) do not display their badge/role in the UI, even though the badge/role is present in the markdown or enriched data.

**Root Cause:**
The badge/role field may be stored in different locations in the enriched data depending on the data pipeline version or markdown structure:
- As a top-level `role` field
- As `metadata.badge`
- As `metadata.role`

The frontend previously only checked one location, so badges could be missing if the field was elsewhere.

**Solution:**
The badge extraction logic in the card component (`ItemCardCollapsed.tsx`) was updated to:
- Prefer `item.role` if present and non-empty
- Otherwise, use `item.metadata.badge` if present and non-empty
- Otherwise, use `item.metadata.role` if present and non-empty
- Handles both string and string[] values for robustness

**Implementation Example:**
```ts
function getBadge(item: EnrichedEntity): string | undefined {
  const tryGet = (val: unknown): string | undefined => {
    if (typeof val === 'string' && val.trim()) return val;
    if (Array.isArray(val) && val.length > 0 && typeof val[0] === 'string') return val[0];
    return undefined;
  };
  if (tryGet(item.role)) return tryGet(item.role);
  if (item.metadata) {
    if (tryGet(item.metadata.badge)) return tryGet(item.metadata.badge);
    if (tryGet(item.metadata.role)) return tryGet(item.metadata.role);
  }
  return undefined;
}
```

**Impact:**
- All character cards now reliably display their badge/role, regardless of where the field is stored in the data.
- The UI is robust to future data pipeline changes regarding badge/role placement.

---

## 1. The Golden Rule: Follow the Data

- The UI can only display the data it receives. If the UI is wrong, the data it's receiving is almost certainly wrong.

---

## 2. UI Shows Blank Cards or Missing Data

- The `ItemCard` component is not receiving the expected data (e.g., `item.name`, `item.image`).

**Steps:**
1. Open `public/enriched-data.json`.
2. Search for the failing character (e.g., "azula").
3. Is the field present at the top level (e.g., `role`, `image`)?
   - **YES:** The pipeline is correct. The problem is in the frontend mapping/prop-drilling.
   - **NO:** The pipeline is broken. Check `scripts/1-parse-markdown.mjs` and `scripts/2-enrich-data.mjs`.

---

## 2a. Quick Script: Find Empty or Corrupted Markdown Files

If you suspect some character markdown files are corrupted, empty, or missing required content, you can use this PowerShell script to quickly identify them:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem raw-data/characters/*.md | % {
  $lines = (Get-Content $_.FullName).Count
  if ($lines -lt 20) { Write-Host "$($_.Name): $lines lines" }
}
```

**How to use:**
1. Open PowerShell in your project root.
2. Paste and run the script above.
3. Any file with a suspiciously low line count (e.g., 1 line) will be printed. These are likely empty or corrupted.

**What to do if files are flagged:**
- Open each flagged file in your editor.
- Re-create or restore it using the canonical template in `docs/templates/character_template.md` and reference other well-formed character files.
- After fixing, re-run your data pipeline (`npm run build:data`).

**Why this works:**
- Most valid character files are 100+ lines. Any file with <20 lines is almost certainly missing required sections or is empty due to a previous error.

**Tip:**
- Use this script any time you suspect silent data issues or after a batch edit to catch accidental file corruption.

## 3. Search Results Are Missing

- The term is not included in the searchable fields when the client-side index is built.

**Steps:**
1. Open `src/search/preprocessor.ts` and check the `textParts` array in `createSearchBlob`.
2. Ensure the field containing your search term is included.
3. Add a `console.log` in `preprocessor.ts` to inspect the `searchBlob` for a specific record.
4. If the blob is correct, check that the FlexSearch index in `useSearch.ts` includes the field.

---

## 4. FlexSearch Indexing Issues

- If no results are returned for any query, check that the index is being built correctly in `useSearch.ts`.
- Ensure the correct fields are indexed and that the data passed to FlexSearch matches the expected structure.
- Use `console.log` to debug the index creation and search steps.

---

## 5. Card Expansion or Modal Layout Issues

- If cards don't expand or the modal layout is broken, check that `expandedCardId` state is managed in `HomeContainer.tsx` and passed down through all components.
- Ensure the modal overlay in `ItemCard.tsx` has proper size constraints and event handling.

---

## 6. General Debugging Tips

- Always start by checking the data in `public/enriched-data.json`.
- Use `console.log` liberally in the preprocessor, search hook, and UI components to trace data flow.
- If a field is missing, fix the data pipeline first, then debug the frontend.

---

## 7. Card Image Missing or Card Appears Smaller

- If a character card does not display an image or appears much smaller than others, it is usually because the `image` field is missing from that character's data in `public/enriched-data.json`.

**Steps:**
1. Open `public/enriched-data.json` and search for the character (e.g., "The Boulder").
2. Check if the `image` field is present and points to a valid image file (e.g., `"image": "the-boulder.jpg"`).
3. If missing, open the corresponding markdown file in `raw-data/characters/` (e.g., `boulder.md`).
4. Add or update the `image` field in the main JSON block:
   ```json
   "image": "the-boulder.jpg"
   ```
5. Ensure the image file exists in `public/assets/images/`.
6. Run `npm run build:data` to regenerate `enriched-data.json`.
7. Refresh the app. The card will now display the image and render at the correct size.

## 8. Card Not Appearing or Expanded Info Missing: Full Debug Process (Fire Nation Man Case Study)

If a character card is missing entirely, or its expanded info does not show up, follow this end-to-end process:

**1. Discover the Problem**
- Notice a card is missing from the UI, or clicking it shows no expanded info.

**2. Check the Data Pipeline**
- Open `public/enriched-data.json` and search for the character (e.g., "fire-nation-man").
- If the character is missing, the data pipeline did not parse the markdown file.
- If present but fields like `expandedView` are empty, the markdown structure is likely wrong.

**3. Inspect the Markdown File**
- Open the relevant file in `raw-data/characters/` (e.g., `fire nation man.md`).
- Ensure the file follows the canonical structure:
  - YAML frontmatter between `---`
  - UI - CARD VIEW in a ```md ... ``` block
  - UI - EXPANDED VIEW in a ```md ... ``` block (all expanded markdown inside)
  - One or more valid JSON blocks in ```json ... ``` blocks (no extra text inside)
- Common mistakes:
  - JSON block not detected (wrong placement, extra blank lines, or extra text)
  - Expanded view not wrapped in a ```md block
  - Multiple or malformed JSON blocks

**4. Fix the Markdown File**
- Remove any extra blank lines or text between the last `---` and the first code block.
- Ensure all JSON blocks are valid and inside triple backticks with `json`.
- Wrap the entire expanded view markdown in a single ```md ... ``` block after the `## UI - EXPANDED VIEW` header.
- Example:
  ```md
  ## ðŸ“– UI - EXPANDED VIEW
  
  ```md
  ...all expanded markdown...
  ```
  ```

**5. Rebuild the Data**
- Run `npm run build:data` to regenerate `public/enriched-data.json`.
- Check the terminal output for `[SUCCESS] Parsed character: ...` for your character.

**6. Verify the Fix**
- Open `public/enriched-data.json` and confirm the character is present and all fields (including `expandedView`) are populated.
- Refresh the app. The card and expanded info should now display correctly.

**Lessons from Fire Nation Man:**
- The parser is strict: JSON blocks must be valid and markdown blocks must be properly wrapped.
- The expanded view will be empty if not inside a ```md block.
- Always check for invisible characters, blank lines, or misplaced code blocks if the pipeline skips a file.

---

**Summary:**
- All data and search issues can be traced by following the data from `enriched-data.json` through the preprocessor, search hook, and UI.
- The new architecture is robust and transparentâ€”debugging is straightforward if you follow the data.
