## üö® Non-Negotiable Tag Rule

**All tags in markdown files must be single, underscore-joined words.**
- No spaces, slashes, or multi-word phrases are allowed in any tag.
- Spaces and slashes are replaced with underscores (e.g., `water nation` ‚Üí `water_nation`).
- All tags are lowercased (e.g., `Firebender` ‚Üí `firebender`).
- This rule applies to all present and future markdown files.
- The enrichment/data pipeline will enforce this and strip or reject any non-compliant tags.
- **Example:**
  - Valid: `water_nation`, `firebender`, `main_villain`
  - Invalid: `water nation`, `main villain`, `main/villain`, `Main Villain`

## üìñ Expanded View Content Issues

### Missing Expanded View Content

**Problem: "Expanded view content not showing in modal despite correct markdown formatting"**
- **Cause:** The parser's regex pattern was too strict and failed to match section headers that included emojis
- **Original Issue:** Headers like `## üìñ UI - EXPANDED VIEW` with emojis weren't being matched by the parser
- **Root Cause:** The original regex `/## [^\n]*UI - EXPANDED VIEW[^\n]*[\s\S]*?```md\r?\n([\s\S]*?)```/` was too specific
- **Solution:** Updated regex to be more flexible: `/## [^\n]*EXPANDED VIEW[^\n]*[\s\S]*?```md\r?\n([\s\S]*?)```/`
- **Debug Steps:**
  1. Run `node scripts/1-parse-markdown.mjs` to see debug output
  2. Look for `[DEBUG] Found Expanded View block: true/false` messages
  3. Check `[DEBUG] Expanded view content length:` to verify content is being extracted
  4. Verify the expanded view content is wrapped in ```md code blocks
- **Validation:** Check `data/parsed-data.json` for the specific entry's `expandedView` field
- **Prevention:** Always test expanded view parsing when adding new content with emoji headers

**Problem: "Expanded view shows '#' instead of actual content"**
- **Cause:** The parser failed to extract content and fell back to a placeholder value
- **Solution:**
  1. Check that expanded view content is properly wrapped in ```md blocks
  2. Verify section header format matches parser expectations
  3. Run debug logging to see what the parser is detecting
  4. Ensure no double ```md markers that could confuse the parser
  5. Check for any special characters or encoding issues in the markdown

**Problem: "Expanded view content is truncated or incomplete"**
- **Cause:** The regex may be stopping at the wrong ``` marker
- **Solution:**
  1. Ensure expanded view content ends with a single ``` marker
  2. Check for any nested code blocks that might confuse the parser
  3. Verify the content doesn't contain unescaped ``` sequences
  4. Test with simpler content to isolate the issue

## Image Issues

### Missing Images
**Problem:** Images not appearing in cards
**Solution:** Check the image fallback system in `src/components/ItemCard/imageFallbacks.ts`

**Common Issues:**
1. **Filename Mismatch:** Image filename doesn't match data slug
   - **Example:** Data slug is `mung-bean-tofu-curry` but image is `mung-bean-&-tofu-curry.jpg`
   - **Fix:** Add fallback mapping: `'mung-bean-tofu-curry': 'mung-bean-&-tofu-curry.jpg'`

2. **Missing Image File:** Image file doesn't exist in `public/assets/images/`
   - **Fix:** Add the image file or update the fallback mapping

3. **Character Name Variations:** Character names in data don't match image filenames
   - **Example:** `'toph-beifong': 'toph.jpg'` for character name variations
   - **Fix:** Add appropriate fallback mapping

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check browser console for 404 errors
2. Verify image file exists in `public/assets/images/`
3. Check data slug matches expected image filename
4. Add fallback mapping if needed
5. Test with universal fallback `404.jpg`

### Image Loading Performance
**Problem:** Slow image loading
**Solution:** Images use lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` attribute
**Optimization:** Images only load when they're about to be visible
