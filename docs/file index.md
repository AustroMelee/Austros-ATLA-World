## üö® Non-Negotiable Tag Rule

**All tags in markdown files must be single, underscore-joined words.**
- No spaces, slashes, or multi-word phrases are allowed in any tag.
- Spaces and slashes are replaced with underscores (e.g., `water nation` ‚Üí `water_nation`).
- All tags are lowercased (e.g., `Firebender` ‚Üí `firebender`).
- This rule applies to all present and future markdown files.
- The enrichment/data pipeline will enforce this and strip or reject any non-compliant tags.
- **Example:**
  - Valid: `water_nation`, `firebender`, `main_villain`
  - Invalid: `water nation`, `main villain`, `main/villain`, `Main Villain`

The dictionary of allowed tags lives in `src/data/tag_dictionary.json`. Aliases
defined there are treated the same as the canonical tag during search.

### Key Frontend Files & Their Roles

#### **Data Flow & State**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`pages/HomeContainer.tsx`** | The stateful "brain" of the app. Fetches `enriched-data.json`, manages `query` and `expandedCardId` state, and calls the `useSearch` hook. |
| **`hooks/useSearch.ts`** | **The core of the search system.** Receives all data, preprocesses it, builds the FlexSearch index in-browser, and returns filtered results. |
| **`hooks/useEnrichedData.ts`** | Fetches and manages the enriched data from the API endpoint, with robust error handling. |
| **`hooks/useImageFallback.ts`** | Manages image loading, error fallback, and status for entity images. |
| **`hooks/useAustrosSearch.ts`** | Enhanced search hook with additional functionality for the Austros system. |
| **`hooks/useCardExpansion.ts`** | Manages card expansion state and modal behavior. |
| **`hooks/useFilters.ts`** | Handles filtering logic and state management. |
| **`hooks/useFilterOptions.ts`** | Provides available filter options based on data. |
| **`hooks/useModalFocus.ts`** | Manages focus trapping and accessibility for modals. |
| **`hooks/useNationColor.ts`** | Provides nation-based color theming. |
| **`hooks/useDebounce.ts`** | Debounces rapid input changes for performance. |
| **`hooks/useSuggestions.ts`** | Provides search suggestions and autocomplete. |
| **`hooks/useRecentSearchRecorder.ts`** | Records and manages recent search history. |
| **`search/preprocessor.ts`** | Helper for `useSearch`. Creates the `searchBlob` from each record to enable comprehensive full-text search. |
| **`pages/Home.tsx`** | The presentational "body" of the app. Receives props from `HomeContainer` and renders the UI. |

#### **UI Components**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`components/SearchBar.tsx`** | Terminal-style search input with phosphor persistence effect (characters flash brighter when typed), cursor wake-up animation, scan lines, custom fonts, block cursor animation, 28px font size, disabled spell-check, custom text selection, and comprehensive CRT effects. |
| **`components/EntityGrid/EntityGrid.tsx`** | Renders the responsive grid of cards. Passes expand/collapse state to each card. **Matrix Integration:** Uses `bg-transparent` to allow Matrix rain to flow through gaps between cards. Shows empty grid without "No results" message when no matches found. |
| **`components/ItemCard/ItemCard.tsx`** | Renders both the small grid card and the full-screen expanded modal view. Contains all logic for a single entity's display. Features responsive text sizing and proper flex layout to prevent name truncation. **Matrix Transparency:** Removed `bg-background` to prevent grey boxes blocking Matrix rain. |
| **`components/MatrixRain/MatrixRain.tsx`** | **NEW (2025):** Canvas-based Matrix digital rain background effect with authentic movie-style characteristics, true randomness, and optimized performance. Replaces 287 lines of CSS with 80-line React component. |
| **`components/CustomMarkdownRenderer.tsx`** | Renders markdown content for the expanded card view, with custom styling. |
| **`components/ThemedCard/ThemedCard.tsx`** | A styled wrapper that applies nation-specific border colors to cards. **Matrix Update:** Added glassmorphism effects with semi-transparent backgrounds, backdrop blur, and Matrix green hover glow. |

| **`components/QuoteBlock/QuoteBlock.tsx`** | Renders quoted text with special styling for markdown content. |
