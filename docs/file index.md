## üö® Non-Negotiable Tag Rule

**All tags in markdown files must be single, underscore-joined words.**
- No spaces, slashes, or multi-word phrases are allowed in any tag.
- Spaces and slashes are replaced with underscores (e.g., `water nation` ‚Üí `water_nation`).
- All tags are lowercased (e.g., `Firebender` ‚Üí `firebender`).
- This rule applies to all present and future markdown files.
- The enrichment/data pipeline will enforce this and strip or reject any non-compliant tags.
- **Example:**
  - Valid: `water_nation`, `firebender`, `main_villain`
  - Invalid: `water nation`, `main villain`, `main/villain`, `Main Villain`

### Key Frontend Files & Their Roles

#### **Data Flow & State**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`pages/HomeContainer.tsx`** | The stateful "brain" of the app. Fetches `enriched-data.json`, manages `query` and `expandedCardId` state, and calls the `useSearch` hook. |
| **`hooks/useSearch.ts`** | **The core of the search system.** Receives all data, preprocesses it, builds the FlexSearch index in-browser, and returns filtered results. |
| **`search/preprocessor.ts`** | Helper for `useSearch`. Creates the `searchBlob` from each record to enable comprehensive full-text search. |
| **`pages/Home.tsx`** | The presentational "body" of the app. Receives props from `HomeContainer` and renders the UI. |

#### **UI Components**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`components/EntityGrid/EntityGrid.tsx`** | Renders the responsive grid of cards. Passes expand/collapse state to each card. |
| **`components/ItemCard/ItemCard.tsx`** | Renders both the small grid card and the full-screen expanded modal view. Contains all logic for a single entity's display. |
| **`components/CustomMarkdownRenderer.tsx`** | Renders markdown content for the expanded card view, with custom styling. |
| **`components/ThemedCard/ThemedCard.tsx`** | A styled wrapper that applies a nation-specific border color to cards. |

## Data & Public Assets
| File/Dir | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`public/enriched-data.json`** | **The single source of truth for the frontend.** A JSON array of all character records, generated by the data pipeline. |
| `public/assets/images/` | All static images used for character cards. |
| `raw-data/` | The raw markdown source files for all encyclopedia entries. |
| `data/` | Intermediate data files used during the build process (`parsed-data.json`). |
