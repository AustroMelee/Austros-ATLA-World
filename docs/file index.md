## üö® Non-Negotiable Tag Rule

**All tags in markdown files must be single, underscore-joined words.**
- No spaces, slashes, or multi-word phrases are allowed in any tag.
- Spaces and slashes are replaced with underscores (e.g., `water nation` ‚Üí `water_nation`).
- All tags are lowercased (e.g., `Firebender` ‚Üí `firebender`).
- This rule applies to all present and future markdown files.
- The enrichment/data pipeline will enforce this and strip or reject any non-compliant tags.
- **Example:**
  - Valid: `water_nation`, `firebender`, `main_villain`
  - Invalid: `water nation`, `main villain`, `main/villain`, `Main Villain`

The dictionary of allowed tags lives in `src/data/tag_dictionary.json`. Aliases
defined there are treated the same as the canonical tag during search.

### Filtering Logic (`src/pages/HomeContainer.tsx`)

**Sequential Pipeline:**
1. **Collections Filter:** Filter by selected collection IDs
2. **Nation Filter:** Filter by nation using partial string matching
3. **Category Filter:** Filter by entity type (character, location, group, etc.)
4. **Sub-Filter:** Apply comprehensive sub-filtering with mapping
5. **Search:** Apply text search to filtered results

**Nation Filtering:**
```typescript
if (activeNations.size > 0) {
  itemsToFilter = itemsToFilter.filter(item => 
    item.nation && activeNations.has(item.nation.toLowerCase())
  );
}
```

**Sub-Filter Mapping:**
- **Age Ranges:** Maps to `ageRange` field with animal exclusion
- **Gender:** Maps to `gender` field with male/female values
- **Bender:** Maps to `isBender` and `bendingElement` fields
- **Role-Based:** Maps filter terms to role, narrativeFunction, and eraAppearances
- **Food Categories:** Maps to food category tags with comprehensive coverage

**Animal Exclusion Logic:**
```typescript
// Excludes animals from age range filters
const animalSpecies = ['bison', 'lemur', 'bear', 'animal', 'spirit'];
const isAnimal = item.species && animalSpecies.some(species => 
  item.species.toLowerCase().includes(species)
);
```

**Food Category Filtering:**
- **12 Sub-Categories:** Comprehensive food categorization system
- **Tag-Based:** Uses food category tags for filtering
- **Nation Integration:** Food items display nation symbols
