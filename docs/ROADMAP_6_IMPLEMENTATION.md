> All mechanics are now fully implemented, including Reversal. See below for details.

### Reversal Mechanic (Implemented)
- **Trigger:** When a character (Aang or Azula) is in a compromised state and low stability, a reversal can occur, turning the tide of battle.
- **Log Example:** `T23 Aang: Reversal`, `T29 Azula: Reversal`
- **AI/Personality:** Aang is more likely to trigger a reversal when desperate; Azula can also trigger reversals, especially in high-risk moments.
- **Effect:** Regains stability, shifts control, and is logged as a dramatic event.
- **Integration:** Fully integrated with disruption-first, narrative-driven battle flow.

## **Overview**
Successfully implemented sophisticated battle resolution triggers that enhance the existing battle system with character-specific desperation moves, multiple draw conditions, and comprehensive event logging.

## **✅ Completed Features**

### **1. Enhanced Battle Log Types**
- **Extended LogEventType**: Added `VICTORY`, `DRAW`, `ESCAPE`, `DESPERATION` event types
- **New BattleResolution Type**: `victory | draw | escape | desperation | mutual_ko`
- **Enhanced BattleCharacter**: Added `flags` object for tracking desperation usage and stalemate conditions

### **2. Desperation Move System**
- **Character-Specific Desperation Moves**:
  - **Azula**: "Phoenix Inferno" (25 power, 8 chi cost, piercing)
  - **Aang**: "Avatar State Surge" (20 power, 6 chi cost, healing bonus)
- **Trigger Conditions**: Health ≤ 10, not used before, sufficient chi (≥6)
- **One-Time Use**: Flagged to prevent reuse in same battle

### **3. Multiple Draw/Escape Conditions**
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Both characters at 0 chi + all moves on cooldown
- **Health Stalemate**: Both characters at ≤1 HP
- **Turn Limit**: Battle ends in draw after 100 turns
- **Mutual KO**: Both characters reduced to 0 HP simultaneously
- **Desperation Exhaustion**: Both characters have used desperation moves

### **4. Character-Specific Dialogue System**
- **Victory Lines**: Unique character-specific victory quotes
- **Defeat Lines**: Character-appropriate defeat responses
- **Desperation Lines**: Dramatic last-stand dialogue
- **Draw Lines**: Stalemate acknowledgment with personality

### **5. Battle Resolution Engine**
- **Pre-Turn Checks**: Resolution triggers checked before normal turn processing
- **Priority System**: Mutual KO → Desperation → Stalemate → Turn Limit → Victory
- **State Management**: Proper flag tracking and battle termination
- **Log Integration**: All resolution events logged with structured data

### **6. Enhanced UI/UX**
- **Event Type Filtering**: New filter options for resolution events
- **Visual Styling**: Color-coded event types with animations
- **Desperation Animation**: Pulsing red border for desperation events
- **Meta Data Display**: Resolution context and character lines

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Files Modified/Created**

#### **New Files:**
- `src/features/battle-simulation/services/battle/resolutionTriggers.ts` - Complete resolution system

#### **Modified Files:**
- `src/features/battle-simulation/types/index.ts` - Extended types
- `src/features/battle-simulation/services/battle/processTurn.ts` - Integration
- `src/features/battle-simulation/services/battle/state.ts` - Flag initialization
- `src/features/battle-log/components/BattleLog.tsx` - UI enhancements
- `src/features/battle-log/components/BattleLog.module.css` - Visual styling

### **Key Functions**

#### **Resolution Detection:**
```typescript
checkResolutionTriggers(state: BattleState, activeCharacter: BattleCharacter)
shouldTriggerDesperation(character: BattleCharacter)
isStalemate(state: BattleState)
isMutualKO(state: BattleState)
isTurnLimitExceeded(state: BattleState, maxTurns: number)
```

#### **Character Dialogue:**
```typescript
getCharacterLine(characterName: string, situation: string)
createResolutionLogEntry(resolution: BattleResolution, state: BattleState, winner?: string, flavor?: string)
```

### **Data Structures**

#### **Desperation Moves:**
```typescript
export const DESPERATION_MOVES: Record<string, Ability> = {
  'azula': {
    name: 'Phoenix Inferno',
    type: 'attack',
    power: 25,
    chiCost: 8,
    cooldown: 0,
    maxUses: 1,
    tags: ['desperation', 'high-damage', 'piercing']
  },
  // ... Aang's move
};
```

#### **Character Lines:**
```typescript
export const CHARACTER_LINES: Record<string, {
  victory: string[];
  defeat: string[];
  desperation: string[];
  draw: string[];
}> = {
  'azula': { /* Azula's dialogue */ },
  'aang': { /* Aang's dialogue */ }
};
```

## **Battle Flow Integration**

### **Turn Processing Sequence:**
1. **Resolution Check**: `checkResolutionTriggers()` called before AI decision
2. **Desperation Trigger**: If conditions met, use desperation move instead of AI choice
3. **State Update**: Mark desperation as used, log resolution event
4. **Battle Continuation**: Normal turn processing or battle termination

### **Event Logging:**
- **Structured Logs**: All resolution events use `BattleLogEntry` format
- **Meta Data**: Resolution type, winner, AI rule context
- **Narrative**: Character-specific dialogue and battle context
- **Filtering**: UI supports filtering by resolution event types

## **Testing Scenarios**

### **Desperation Triggers:**
- ✅ Character at ≤10 HP triggers desperation move
- ✅ Desperation move can only be used once per battle
- ✅ Insufficient chi prevents desperation trigger
- ✅ Desperation moves have enhanced power and effects

### **Draw Conditions:**
- ✅ Resource exhaustion (0 chi + all cooldowns) triggers draw
- ✅ Health stalemate (both ≤1 HP) triggers draw
- ✅ Turn limit (100 turns) triggers draw
- ✅ Mutual KO triggers draw
- ✅ Both desperation moves used triggers draw

### **Victory Conditions:**
- ✅ Normal KO detection still works
- ✅ Desperation moves can secure victory
- ✅ Character-specific victory dialogue displays

### **Edge Cases:**
- ✅ Simultaneous KO handled correctly
- ✅ Infinite loop prevention via turn limit
- ✅ Resource management prevents desperation abuse
- ✅ All triggers logged with proper context

## **UI/UX Enhancements**

### **Visual Feedback:**
- **Color Coding**: Each resolution type has distinct color scheme
- **Animations**: Desperation events have pulsing animation
- **Icons**: Event type badges with appropriate styling
- **Filtering**: Users can filter log by specific resolution types

### **Accessibility:**
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for filters
- **Screen Reader**: Structured data for assistive technologies
- **High Contrast**: Clear visual distinction between event types

## **Performance Considerations**

### **Optimizations:**
- **Efficient Checks**: Resolution triggers use minimal computation
- **Lazy Loading**: Character dialogue loaded only when needed
- **Memoization**: Resolution state cached to prevent redundant calculations
- **Batch Updates**: Multiple state changes batched for performance

### **Memory Management:**
- **Flag Cleanup**: Resolution flags reset between battles
- **Log Rotation**: Battle logs don't accumulate indefinitely
- **Event Pooling**: Reuse event objects where possible

## **Future Enhancements**

### **Potential Additions:**
- **Escape Mechanics**: Character-specific escape conditions
- **Victory Animations**: Special visual effects for different victory types
- **Post-Battle Summary**: Detailed battle statistics and analysis
- **Replay System**: Ability to replay battles with resolution highlights
- **Character Development**: Desperation moves unlock through progression

### **AI Integration:**
- **Personality-Based Triggers**: AI considers character personality for desperation
- **Tactical Awareness**: AI recognizes when opponent is likely to use desperation
- **Counter-Strategies**: AI develops responses to desperation moves

## **Conclusion**

Roadmap #6 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive battle resolution triggers that enhance the tactical depth and narrative richness of the Avatar Battle Arena. The system provides:

- **Sophisticated End Conditions**: Multiple ways for battles to conclude
- **Character Authenticity**: Personality-driven dialogue and behavior
- **Visual Polish**: Engaging UI with clear event distinction
- **Technical Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- **Extensible Architecture**: Foundation for future enhancement

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding significant new functionality that elevates the battle experience to a new level of sophistication and engagement.
