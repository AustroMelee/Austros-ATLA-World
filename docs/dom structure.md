# DOM Structure & Theming Engine Documentation (2025 Update)

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the application's rendered Document Object Model (DOM), its styling architecture powered by Tailwind CSS, and the resulting computed styles that define the final visual appearance. It serves as a technical reference for understanding how the application's "Matrix/CRT" aesthetic is achieved.

## 1. High-Level DOM Structure

The application renders a modern and accessible DOM, structured for a single-page React application. The key architectural elements are:

### `<html>` Root Element:
- Standard HTML5 document structure
- Includes Vite-specific scripts (`/@vite/client`, `/@react-refresh`) for hot module reloading during development
- All CSS, including Tailwind's base/components/utilities and custom styles, is injected directly into the `<head>` for fast rendering

### `<body>` Element:
- Contains a single div with `id="root"`, which is the mounting point for the entire React application
- No other direct children, adhering to best practices for React apps

### React Application Root (`<div id="root">`)
The primary container for all React components:
- A Layout component wraps the main content, establishing a flex column layout that spans the full viewport height (`min-h-screen`)
- **Critical Stacking Context:** The `isolate` class is applied to a parent container to create a new stacking context. This is essential for ensuring the `z-index: -1` on the Matrix Rain canvas works correctly and doesn't get hidden behind its parent's background

### Core UI Components:

#### Matrix Rain (`<canvas>`):
- A `<canvas>` element is rendered with `position: fixed` and `z-index: -1`
- This places it as a persistent background layer behind all other content
- **2025 Update:** Canvas-based Matrix digital rain with authentic movie-style characteristics
- **Performance Optimized:** Uses `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setInterval` for smooth 60fps animation with adaptive frame skipping
- **Modal Integration:** Reduces intensity when modal is open (frame skipping, reduced opacity, dimmed colors)
- **Responsive Design:** Auto-calculates column count based on screen width
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of animation frames and event listeners

#### Main Content (`<main>`):
- A semantic `<main>` tag holds the primary view
- Structured as a flex container holding the CollectionsSidebar and the main content grid

#### Collections Sidebar (`<aside>`):
- A sticky-positioned sidebar that remains visible during scroll
- Uses `backdrop-blur-sm` and a semi-transparent background (`bg-black/80`) to create a "glassmorphism" effect over the Matrix rain

#### Filter Bar (`<div class="FilterBar">`):
- **NEW (2025):** Multi-layered filtering interface positioned above the search bar
- Contains three sections: Nations, Categories, and Subcategories
- **Nation Filtering:** Uses partial string matching to handle full nation names ("Fire Nation", "Earth Kingdom") with single-word filter buttons ("fire", "earth")
- **Sub-Filter Mapping:** Translates filter button terms to data values (e.g., "villains" → "antagonist", "heroes" → "protagonist", "deuteragonist", "mentor")
- **Multi-Field Coverage:** Checks tags array, role field, narrativeFunction, and eraAppearances roles for comprehensive filtering
- **Multiple Selection:** Nations support multi-select (OR logic), Categories support single-select
- Uses Matrix-themed styling with glassmorphism effects
- Responsive design with flex-wrap layout

#### Search Bar (`<form>`):
- Positioned below the Filter Bar
- Styled with the project's CRT theme
- Terminal-style input with custom cursor and glow effects

#### Entity Grid (`<div>`):
- A responsive `flex-wrap` container that holds the character cards
- Its `bg-transparent` property is crucial for allowing the Matrix rain to be visible in the gaps between cards

#### Character Cards (`<div>`):
- Each card is a complex component featuring relative positioning to contain its child elements (like the collection button and role badge)
- Applies the `matrix-card-glow` class for themed hover effects
- **Matrix Integration:** Transparent backgrounds allow Matrix rain to show through

## 2. Styling Architecture & Theming Engine

The application's visual identity is driven by a powerful combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS properties (variables), creating a cohesive and maintainable theming engine.

### a. Core Technologies

#### Tailwind CSS (v3.4.17):
- The primary styling engine
- Provides a utility-first framework for all layout, color, typography, and spacing
- The CSS is generated Just-In-Time (JIT), meaning only the classes used in the source code are included in the final stylesheet

#### Custom CSS Properties (Variables):
A set of global CSS variables are defined in the `:root` selector. These act as the central source of truth for the application's thematic colors:

```css
:root {
  --crt-green: #70ab6c;
  --crt-green-glow: rgba(112, 171, 108, 0.4);
  --search-bg: #061911;
}
```

By using these variables (e.g., `border-color: var(--crt-green)`), the entire theme can be modified by changing just a few lines of code.

### b. The "Matrix/CRT" Aesthetic Breakdown

The signature look of the application is achieved through a combination of custom CSS classes and animations:

#### Global Background:
- The `<body>` element has a dark base color (`#0D1117`) overlaid with a subtle, repeating linear gradient that creates faint horizontal scanlines
- Combined with a `crt-flicker` animation that gently modulates the opacity, mimicking the refresh cycle of an old CRT monitor

#### Custom Fonts:
The project loads two custom fonts via `@font-face`:
- `'Glass_TTY_VT220'`: The primary font for terminal-style text, used heavily in the search bar and other UI elements
- `'Perfect_DOS_VGA_437'`: A secondary retro font

#### Glow & Dithering Effects:
A suite of custom utility classes provide the CRT effects:
- `.crt-glow-text`: Applies a multi-layered text-shadow using `--crt-green` and `--crt-green-glow` to make text appear luminous
- `.crt-glow-border`: Applies a box-shadow to borders for a similar glowing effect
- `.crt-dither` & `.crt-screen`: Use repeating linear gradients to create pixelated dithering and scanline patterns on component backgrounds

#### Custom Scrollbars:
The scrollbars are extensively styled using `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements to match the CRT theme, featuring green thumbs, glowing tracks, and pixelated textures.

#### Themed Interactions:
- **Text Selection:** The default blue text selection highlight is overridden globally to use `--crt-green` as the background, maintaining theme consistency
- **Card Hover (`.matrix-card-glow`)**: A sophisticated multi-layer box-shadow and a pseudo-element (`::before`) with a pulsing gradient animation create a dynamic and visually impressive hover effect on cards

#### Animations:
Custom `@keyframes` are defined for:
- `crt-flicker`: Subtle body opacity change
- `phosphor-fade` & `cursor-wake-up`: Advanced animations for the search bar text and cursor to enhance the terminal feel
- `scanline-drift`: A slow vertical drift for the search bar's internal scanlines

## 3. Filtering System DOM Integration (2025 Update)

### FilterBar Component Structure:
```html
<div class="FilterBar w-full max-w-4xl mb-6 p-4 bg-neutral-900/50 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-lg border border-neutral-700">
  <!-- Nations Filter -->
  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-neutral-300 mb-2">Nations</h3>
    <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
      <!-- Nation buttons with toggle states -->
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Core Filters -->
  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-neutral-300 mb-2">Categories</h3>
    <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
      <!-- Category buttons with single selection -->
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Sub Filters (conditional) -->
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-neutral-300 mb-2">Subcategories</h3>
    <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
      <!-- Dynamic subcategory buttons -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Filter Button States:
- **Default State:** `bg-neutral-800 text-neutral-400 hover:bg-neutral-700 hover:text-neutral-200`
- **Active Nations:** `bg-neutral-600 text-white`
- **Active Categories:** `bg-blue-600 text-white`
- **Active Subcategories:** `bg-green-600 text-white`

## 4. Computed Styles Analysis

The "Computed" styles section shows the final, calculated values that the browser applies to an element after all CSS rules (from user agent, Tailwind, and custom styles) have been resolved.

### Key Takeaways from the `<html>` Element's Computed Styles:

#### Layout & Box Model:
- `display: block;` and `box-sizing: border-box;` are applied, which is standard for modern web layouts
- The width and height are determined by the viewport size (e.g., 1372px x 2385.79px), indicating the content extends beyond the initial screen view

#### Typography:
- The base `font-family` is a standard sans-serif stack (`ui-sans-serif`, `system-ui`, etc.), as defined by Tailwind's base styles
- The root `font-size` is 16px with a `line-height` of 24px (1.5), providing a solid, readable foundation for the rest of the application's text

#### Color & Background:
- The `background-color` is `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` (transparent), as the visible background is controlled by the `<body>` element
- The default `color` for text is `rgb(0, 0, 0)` but is immediately overridden by more specific rules on child elements

#### Scrolling Behavior:
- `scroll-behavior: smooth;` is a key property. This is the global rule that enables "buttery smooth scrolling" for all native in-page anchor links, as per the feature plan

#### CSS Variables (Custom Properties):
- The computed styles confirm that all `--tw-*` variables from Tailwind and all custom `--crt-*` variables are successfully inherited by the `<html>` element and are available for use by any child element in the DOM tree. This is the foundation of the theming engine

## 5. Matrix Rain Technical Implementation (2025 Update)

### Canvas-Based Rendering:
- **Single Component:** 122-line React component replacing 287+ lines of CSS
- **True Randomness:** Every character randomly generated each frame
- **Authentic Aesthetic:** Movie-accurate bright leading characters with proper trails
- **Performance:** Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation with adaptive frame skipping
- **Modal Integration:** Reduces intensity when modal is open (frame skipping, reduced opacity, dimmed colors)
- **Responsive:** Auto-calculates columns based on screen width
- **Clean Integration:** Transparent backgrounds allow rain to show through UI gaps

### Rendering Strategy:
1. **Dual-Layer Rendering:** Fade layer followed by character layer for clean trails
2. **Progressive Fade:** Optimized fade opacity (`rgba(13, 17, 23, 0.2)`) prevents muddy background
3. **Character Hierarchy:** Bright leaders (`#c8ffc8`) over standard trails (`#70ab6c`)
4. **Adaptive Performance:** Frame skipping and reduced opacity when modal is open
5. **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of animation frames and event listeners

### Performance Optimizations:
- **requestAnimationFrame:** Replaces `setInterval` for smoother animation and better performance
- **Frame Skipping:** Reduces animation intensity when modal is open (3x frame skip)
- **Adaptive Opacity:** Reduces fade opacity from 0.2 to 0.15 when modal is open
- **Color Dimming:** Leading characters use dimmed color (`#70ab6c`) when modal is open
- **Trail Opacity:** Reduces trail opacity from 0.7 to 0.4 when modal is open
- **Canvas Opacity:** Reduces overall canvas opacity from 1 to 0.5 when modal is open

## 6. Accessibility & Responsive Design

### Accessibility Features:
- All interactive elements have proper ARIA roles and labels
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported throughout the filtering system
- High contrast colors maintain accessibility standards
- Screen readers can access all filter options and navigation elements

### Responsive Design:
- The layout adapts to all screen sizes with larger tap targets for mobile devices
- Filter buttons use flex-wrap for responsive behavior
- Matrix rain auto-calculates column count based on screen width
- Glassmorphism effects work across all device types
