## ðŸŽ¨ Styling & UI Policy

### 1. CSS Source of Truth: Tailwind CSS (v3.4.3)

The project is pinned to `tailwindcss@3.4.3` due to a critical, unrecoverable environmental bug with the v4+ CLI installer on the primary development machine.

-   **Policy:** **Never upgrade `tailwindcss` above `3.4.3`** without first verifying, in a disposable clone, that the CLI binary (`tailwindcss.cmd`) appears in `node_modules/.bin` after a clean install.
-   **Usage:** All styling must be done with Tailwind CSS utility classes. Always use the local CLI for builds:
    ```powershell
    .\node_modules\.bin\tailwindcss.cmd -i ./src/styles/pure-tailwind.css -o ./src/styles/generated-tailwind.css
    ```
-   **Manual Build Required:** The build process is not automated. **You must manually run the command above** after any change to Tailwind config, theme, or class usage for your changes to appear in the UI.
-   **Import Policy:** The main entry point (`main.tsx`) must import the correct generated CSS file (e.g., `generated-tailwind.css`).

### 2. Tailwind JIT: Literal Class Requirement & Troubleshooting

-   **JIT Literal Class Policy:** Tailwind JIT only generates classes it finds as literal strings in scanned files. If a class (e.g., `bg-neutral-900`) is missing from the output CSS, ensure it is present as a literal string in your codebase and restart the dev server or rebuild Tailwind.
-   **Dynamic Class Pitfall:** If you use dynamic class names or template strings, JIT may not detect them. Always add a dummy reference if needed, e.g.:
    ```jsx
    <div className="bg-neutral-900 hidden" />
    ```
-   **Manual Rebuild:** After adding new classes, always run the Tailwind build command and restart the dev server to ensure the new classes are generated and available.
-   **Validation:** If a class is still missing, check the generated CSS file for the class. If absent, add a literal reference and rebuild.

### 3. UI/UX Rules

-   **Card Grid Hover:** **Always use Flexbox (`flex flex-wrap`) for card grids**, never CSS Grid. Grid layouts will clip hover effects like scaling and shadows. The grid container must have sufficient padding (e.g., `p-8`) to prevent edge clipping.
-   **Modal/Overlay Borders:** **Never apply `border`, `rounded-*`, or `shadow-*` styles to both a modal container and its child card.** Only the innermost component should have these "card-like" styles to prevent double borders or visual artifacts.
-   **Responsive Layouts:** Use `flex-wrap` for tag/pill groups. Use `flex-shrink-0`, `flex-1`, and `truncate` for list items to ensure they adapt gracefully.

### 4. Card Styling & Scaling

-   **Card Width:** Card width is set in `EntityGrid` (currently `w-[188px]`).
-   **Card Content Scaling:** All internal card content (image, text, etc.) is scaled in `ItemCard` to match the card size for visual consistency.
-   **Card Name Wrapping:** Card names use `line-clamp-2` (multi-line clamping) for accessibility and to avoid hidden content. This requires the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin, which is enabled in `tailwind.config.js`.
-   **Grid Layout:** The card grid uses flexbox for layout, ensuring cards stretch to fill the row and maintain a consistent appearance.
-   **SRP:** All card styling and scaling should be handled in the relevant component (`EntityGrid` for layout/width, `ItemCard` for content), not globally.

### 5. Hiding/Unhiding UI Features (Filters & Collections)

-   **Convention:** To hide a UI feature (e.g., FilterSidebar, FilterPanel, CollectionsSidebar, CollectionsPanel), set the component to return `null` and add a comment at the top: "[Component] is hidden from the UI on user request. To re-enable, restore the original export."
-   **To Unhide:** Restore the original export and implementation in the component file.
-   **Canonical Toggle:** This is the canonical method for feature toggling in this projectâ€”no conditional rendering in parent components, no feature flags. All toggling is done at the component export level for clarity and maintainability.
