## üß† The Core Philosophy

### The "Non-Negotiable Rule"
This project operates under a **single, unbreakable principle**:

> **"Every file must be connected unless it's documentation or tests"**

This means:
- ‚úÖ All components are imported and used
- ‚úÖ All hooks are consumed by components
- ‚úÖ All utilities are called by other code
- ‚ùå No orphaned files floating in the codebase
- ‚ùå No dead code or unused imports

### Why This Matters
- **Maintainability:** Easy to understand what's actually used
- **Performance:** No unused code in the bundle
- **Clarity:** Clear dependency relationships
- **Quality:** Forces good architectural decisions

### How to Follow It
1. **Before committing:** Run `npm run lint` to catch unused imports
2. **When adding files:** Ensure they're imported somewhere
3. **When removing features:** Delete all related files
4. **When refactoring:** Update all import paths

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Understand the change scope**
   - Is it UI, data, or both?
   - Does it require data pipeline changes?
   - Are new types or components needed?

2. **Follow the data flow**
   - Raw data ‚Üí Parsing ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí UI
   - Update appropriate files in order
   - Run `npm run build:data` after data changes

3. **Test thoroughly**
   - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check`
   - Test in browser with various scenarios
   - Verify data integrity with `npm run validate:data`

### Adding New Content
1. **Create markdown file** in appropriate `raw-data/` folder
2. **Follow template structure** with YAML frontmatter
3. **Add image** to `public/assets/images/`
4. **Run data pipeline:** `npm run build:data`
5. **Test in UI** and verify display

### Adding New Features
1. **Plan the architecture** - which components/hooks are needed?
2. **Create components** following existing patterns
3. **Add types** to `src/types/domainTypes.ts` if needed
4. **Update documentation** to reflect changes
5. **Test thoroughly** and ensure no orphaned files
