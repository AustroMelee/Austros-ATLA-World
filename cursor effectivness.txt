✅ Cursor 100% Effectiveness Checklist
1. Initial Setup
 Install latest Cursor (update regularly)

 Connect all relevant MCP servers (GitHub, Context7, Puppeteer, etc.)

 Enable/authorize your repo & project folders

2. Project Context & Rules
 Create a project rules file

Use the “New Cursor Rule” command (CMD/CTRL + Shift + P → New Cursor Rule)

Add a clear project description and file structure at the top

 Keep rules minimal and targeted

Only add rules for issues Cursor actually repeats

Update rules whenever you see persistent AI mistakes

3. Best Practices for Prompting
 Always provide file context in your prompt (e.g., “see @utils.ts”)

 For big tasks, end with:
“Ask any questions that would clarify this task for you.”

 Avoid vague prompts; be explicit about goals and constraints

 If prompt ends in a “?”, instruct Cursor to answer, not generate code

4. Code Review & Validation
 Review all AI-suggested code before applying

 Manually refactor core/critical sections (don’t trust AI with your project’s “heart”)

 Use Composer/Agent for small, low-risk changes

 Use Chat/Ask for everything else (and always review diffs)

5. Automation & Guardrails
 Set up validation scripts (e.g., linters, type checks)

 Add pre-commit git hooks to block bad changes

 Use templates/snippets for key files to standardize structure

6. Learning & Adapting
 Refine rules as you discover new pain points or patterns

 Update your context (rules, docs) as the project grows

 Keep spec sheets/checklists for major features—attach to prompts

7. Recovery & Troubleshooting
 Restore from checkpoint if AI output spirals

 If stuck, clarify instructions and try again, or step in manually

 Iterate on one prompt rather than scatter new ones—maintains context

8. Community & Power Tips
 Review popular community rules/templates for your stack

 Double check with ChatGPT/Claude for complex logic or bugfixes

 Bookmark the Cursor Guardrails repo for best practices

9. Miscellaneous
 Update Cursor regularly for bug fixes & features

 Participate in the r/cursor community for new strategies

⭐ Final Reminder:
Cursor is a powerful assistant—not a replacement for your own review and judgment. Use these steps as a workflow, and you’ll avoid nearly all common pitfalls.
