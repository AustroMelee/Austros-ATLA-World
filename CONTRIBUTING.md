## Unused/Legacy File Policy

- All orphaned/unused files are listed in [UNUSED_FILES_REPORT.md](./UNUSED_FILES_REPORT.md), auto-generated by CI.
- Every flagged file must have a rationale or legacy tag in its header.
- Do not use or resurrect files flagged as @legacy or listed in the report without consulting the project architect.
- See the decision log and changelog links in the report for context. 

## Lint & Auto-fix

Run `npm run lint:fix` to apply ESLint auto-fixes. The CI workflow rejects commits with any remaining lint errors.
