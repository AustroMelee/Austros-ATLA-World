The #1 feature a digital encyclopedia should have but rarely does is **dynamic, context-aware content generation** 📚✨.

Most encyclopedias, like Wikipedia, are static—articles are written, edited, and updated manually, often lagging behind real-time events or user needs. A truly modern encyclopedia should:

- 🧠 **Adapt to user context**: Generate or tailor content based on the user’s knowledge level, interests, or specific question. For example, a beginner gets a simple explanation, while an expert gets technical depth.
- 🌐 **Real-time updates**: Pull from reliable sources (e.g., verified X posts, news, or academic papers) to provide up-to-the-minute information, especially for evolving topics like tech or current events.
- 🔗 **Seamless integration of sources**: Instead of just citing references, it should weave them into a narrative, showing how facts connect across disciplines.
- 🤖 **Interactive exploration**: Let users “query” the encyclopedia conversationally, drilling down into details or exploring related topics via AI-driven suggestions.

Few platforms do this. Wikipedia relies on human editors, and even AI-driven tools like search engines don’t synthesize knowledge into cohesive, encyclopedia-style entries. This feature would make knowledge more accessible, relevant, and engaging.
