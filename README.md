[📝 Cursor Effectiveness Checklist](./docs/cursor-effectiveness.md)

## �� **Core Features**

### **Battle System**
- **Advanced AI Decision Making** - Context-aware tactical AI with personality-driven behavior
- **Collateral Damage System** - Environmental damage tracking with location-specific tolerance
- **Mental State Decay** - Irreversible mental state changes affecting character behavior
- **Dynamic Narrative Generation** - Character-specific storytelling with emotional arcs
- **Real-time Battle Simulation** - Turn-based combat with escalation mechanics

### **Character System**
- **Personality-Driven AI** - Each character has unique tactical preferences and decision-making patterns
- **Mental State Tracking** - Characters can become "unhinged" or "broken" with permanent effects
- **Environmental Awareness** - Characters consider collateral damage when choosing moves
- **Identity-Based Behavior** - Tactical decisions influenced by character personality and current mental state

### **Technical Excellence**
- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - 99th percentile type safety with zero runtime type errors
- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns with single responsibility principle
- **Error Boundaries** - Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Accessibility First** - WCAG compliant UI with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd avatar-battle-arena
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Development**
```bash
# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build
npm run build
```

## Lint & Auto-fix

Run `npm run lint:fix` to apply ESLint auto-fixes. The CI workflow rejects commits with any remaining lint errors.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Core Systems**
- **Battle Engine** - Core combat mechanics and turn processing
- **AI Controller** - Advanced decision-making with personality integration
- **Narrative System** - Dynamic storytelling with character-specific content
- **State Management** - Centralized battle state with mental state tracking
- **Collateral Damage** - Environmental damage and location tolerance system

### **Key Components**
- **Character Selection** - Interactive character picker with stats display
- **Location Selection** - Battle environment selection with damage tolerance
- **Battle Simulation** - Real-time battle visualization with narrative
- **Technical Log** - Detailed battle analysis and AI decision tracking

## 🎮 **Game Mechanics**

### **Collateral Damage System**
- **Environmental Damage** - Powerful moves can damage the battle environment
- **Location Tolerance** - Different locations have varying damage tolerance levels
- **Narrative Impact** - Environmental damage creates story-driven consequences
- **AI Awareness** - Characters consider collateral damage when choosing moves

### **Mental State Decay**
- **Irreversible Changes** - Characters can become permanently "unhinged" or "broken"
- **Behavioral Impact** - Mental state affects AI decision-making and move selection
- **Narrative Integration** - Mental state changes are reflected in storytelling
- **Escalation Mechanics** - Desperate situations trigger forced escalation

### **AI Decision Making**
- **Personality-Driven** - Each character has unique tactical preferences
- **Context-Aware** - AI considers health, chi, opponent state, and environment
- **Pattern Recognition** - AI adapts to opponent behavior patterns
- **Environmental Factors** - Location and collateral damage influence decisions
