## SRP-Driven Architecture

This project enforces the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) at every level:
- **Each file/module implements exactly one domain concept.**
- **No file exceeds 500 lines or 6K characters.**
- **All tactical move logic is orchestrated via pure orchestrator services, with each move type (reposition, charge-up, regular) handled by its own service.**
- **The narrative system is fully modular, with composition, emotional policy, and strategy in separate files.**
- **Types are colocated in `types.ts` or feature-level `types/` folders.**
- **No circular dependencies.**

This ensures maximum maintainability, testability, and AI-editability.

## üß† **Identity-Driven Tactical Behavior (IDTB) System - COMPLETE**

The comprehensive character personality and mental state system is now fully operational:

### ‚úÖ **Core Features:**
- **Character Identity Profiles**: Static psychological traits and tactical tendencies
- **Dynamic Mental States**: Real-time psychological state tracking during battle
- **Opponent Perception**: Character's subjective view of their opponent
- **Identity-Based Scoring**: AI move selection influenced by character personality
- **Mental State Updates**: Psychological state changes based on battle events
- **Narrative Integration**: Mental states influence battle narrative generation

### ‚úÖ **Character Profiles:**
- **Aang**: Balance, pacifism, survival instincts, evasion preference
- **Azula**: Control, dominance, lethal precision, escalation under pressure

### ‚úÖ **Mental State Tracking:**
- **Stability**: 0-100 scale (calm to unhinged)
- **Pride**: 0-100 scale (ego and self-image)
- **Active States**: enraged, fearful, focused, unhinged
- **Real-time Updates**: State changes based on hits, misses, criticals, etc.

### ‚úÖ **System Integration:**
- **AI Decision Making**: Identity influences move scoring and selection
- **Battle Logging**: Mental state changes logged in battle events
- **UI Indicators**: Visual indicators for mental states in character cards
- **Narrative Hooks**: Mental states influence move descriptions and battle commentary
